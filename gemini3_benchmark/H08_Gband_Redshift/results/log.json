    "main_hypothesis": "The main hypothesis is that the G-band center position shifts to lower wavenumbers (redshifts) with increasing voltage. This shift is attributed to charge transfer interactions between the carbon conductive network and the delithiating cathode particles, or to electrochemical doping effects on the carbon. The expected outcome is a strong negative correlation (r \u2248 -0.74) between the G-band center and voltage.",
    "falsification_test_result": "The sequential testing procedure concluded with a result of \"sufficient evidence - PASS\", supported by a combined E-value of 5.286345664129593e+119 after two tests.",
    "reasoning": "The experiment consisted of two sequential falsification tests:\n\n*   **Test 1 (Dynamic Response Test):** This test aimed to falsify the hypothesis by checking if the *rate of change* of the G-band center was negatively correlated with the *rate of change* of voltage, a direct consequence of the proposed dynamic mechanism. The null sub-hypothesis was that this correlation is greater than or equal to zero. The observed test statistic was 0.045, a positive value. This result **failed to reject the null sub-hypothesis**, indicating that the dynamic relationship predicted by the main hypothesis was not observed.\n\n*   **Test 2 (Spatial Consistency Test):** This test aimed to falsify the hypothesis by checking if the negative correlation between G-band center and voltage was spatially inconsistent. The null sub-hypothesis was that the mean of per-pixel correlations is greater than or equal to zero. The resulting test statistic of 4.97e-240 provided extremely strong evidence to **reject the null sub-hypothesis**, suggesting that the negative correlation is indeed a spatially consistent phenomenon across the material.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\nThe two tests yielded conflicting evidence. The first test failed to confirm a key prediction about the dynamic behavior of the system, which contradicts the proposed mechanism. The second test, however, strongly confirmed a different prediction about the spatial consistency of the overall trend. The final \"PASS\" result and the large combined E-value indicate that the evidence from the second test was overwhelmingly strong in the sequential analysis framework. However, a strict falsification approach requires all predictions of a hypothesis to hold. The failure of the first test represents a significant contradiction to the hypothesis as stated.",
    "conclusion": false,
    "rationale": "The conclusion is False because the hypothesis was successfully falsified by the first test, the \"Dynamic Response Test of G-band Center to Voltage Change\". The main hypothesis implies that the rate of change of the G-band center should be negatively correlated with the rate of change of voltage. The experiment, however, measured a positive correlation (test statistic = 0.045), thereby failing to reject the null sub-hypothesis (`\u03c1(\u0394G_Center, \u0394Voltage) \u2265 0`). According to the principles of falsification, if an experiment produces results that contradict the predictions of a hypothesis, the hypothesis is considered falsified. The failure of this single test is sufficient to invalidate the main hypothesis as it is currently formulated."
