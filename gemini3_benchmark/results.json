The test provided corroborative evidence by showing that a secondary indicator of the state of charge (`Eg_Center`) exhibits the same trend of increasing spatial standard deviation with voltage. This observation strengthens the claim that the underlying mechanism is a general increase in electrochemical heterogeneity. Therefore, the hypothesis is concluded to be true based on this test.\nH02 completed in 113.8s | Conclusion: True\n",

This provides strong statistical evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis in favor of the alternative, which posits a mean correlation less than zero (\u03bc\u1d63 < 0).

The experiment failed to falsify the main hypothesis. The observed data provided sufficient evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis, thereby confirming that the A1g peak redshift is spatially consistent with increasing voltage, a key component of the main hypothesis.\nH01 completed in 143.9s | Conclusion: True\n",

The null sub-hypothesis was constructed to directly challenge the main hypothesis. Its rejection provides affirmative evidence from this test that the ID/IG ratio's rate of change becomes significantly more negative above 4.3V, which corroborates the main hypothesis's claim of a unique activation event at high potentials.\nH03 completed in 148.3s | Conclusion: True\n",

While the first test on Eg peak evolution did not find a significant difference between edge and center pixels, the second, more direct test on the correlation between A1g peak position and applied voltage revealed a highly significant difference (p = 8.99e-10). This result provides strong evidence that the electrochemical response is not homogeneous across the electrode surface, thereby refuting the main hypothesis.\nH06 completed in 239.3s | Conclusion: False\n",
