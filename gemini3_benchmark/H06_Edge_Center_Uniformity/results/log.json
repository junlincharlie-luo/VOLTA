    "main_hypothesis": "Pixels at the edges of the 30\u00d730 mapping region exhibit statistically similar A1g peak evolution compared to center pixels, which indicates homogeneous electrochemical accessibility across the mapped electrode area at the 30 \u03bcm scale.",
    "falsification_test_result": "The sequential falsification test procedure passed, indicating that sufficient evidence was found to falsify the main hypothesis.",
    "reasoning": "The procedure involved two sequential tests to challenge the main hypothesis of homogeneous electrochemical accessibility:\n*   **Test 1 (Homogeneity of Eg Peak Evolution Test):** This test examined another vibrational mode (Eg peak) and found no statistically significant difference in its evolution between edge and center pixels (p = 0.469). This result, on its own, is consistent with the main hypothesis.\n*   **Test 2 (A1g Peak-Voltage Correlation Homogeneity Test):** This test evaluated the dynamic response of the A1g peak to applied voltage. It found a highly statistically significant difference between the edge and center pixels (p = 8.99e-10). This indicates that the material in the edge and center regions responds differently to the electrochemical driving force.\n\nThe sequential analysis concluded after the second test, as the extremely low p-value provided sufficient statistical evidence (E-value > 12175) to reject the premise of homogeneity. The strong evidence of a different functional response to voltage in the second test directly contradicts and successfully falsifies the main hypothesis, despite the first test failing to do so.",
    "conclusion": false,
    "rationale": "The conclusion is False because the sequential testing procedure successfully falsified the main hypothesis. While the first test on Eg peak evolution did not find a significant difference between edge and center pixels, the second, more direct test on the correlation between A1g peak position and applied voltage revealed a highly significant difference (p = 8.99e-10). This result provides strong evidence that the electrochemical response is not homogeneous across the electrode surface, thereby refuting the main hypothesis."
