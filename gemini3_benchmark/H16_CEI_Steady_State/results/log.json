    "main_hypothesis": "The main hypothesis is that the cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layer thickness stabilizes after approximately 50 cycles, as indicated by the saturation of D-band intensity changes.",
    "falsification_test_result": "The test passed, finding sufficient evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis with a combined E-value of 3.35e+153.",
    "reasoning": "The experiment aimed to falsify the main hypothesis by testing a specific consequence: if the CEI thickness stabilizes after 50 cycles, then the average D-band intensity should remain constant thereafter. The test compared the D-band intensity from a period just after the supposed saturation (cycles 50-60) with a much later period (cycles 100-110). The null sub-hypothesis was that the mean intensities of these two periods would be equal. The test result provided very strong statistical evidence (E-value >> 1) to reject this null sub-hypothesis, indicating that the mean D-band intensity between the two periods is not equal and has changed significantly.",
    "conclusion": false,
    "rationale": "The main hypothesis of stabilization after 50 cycles was falsified. The experiment demonstrated with high statistical significance that the D-band intensity, a proxy for CEI thickness, continued to evolve long after the 50-cycle mark. This contradicts the core claim that the CEI layer's growth had stabilized."
