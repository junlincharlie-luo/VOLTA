  "parsed_result": {
    "main_hypothesis": "The battery exhibits capacity retention below 80% of initial capacity after 500 electrochemical cycles.",
    "falsification_test_result": "The sequential falsification test procedure passed after one test, providing sufficient evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis. The final combined E-value was approximately 3,916,302.25.",
    "reasoning": "The experiment conducted was the \"Spatially Heterogeneous Surface Degradation Test\". This test aimed to detect early signs of irreversible degradation by measuring the spatial variance of the ID/IG ratio on the cathode surface over time. The null sub-hypothesis stated that this variance would not show a statistically significant positive trend. The test result was a \"PASS\", indicating that the null sub-hypothesis was successfully rejected. This rejection provides strong statistical evidence for the alternate sub-hypothesis: that the spatial variance of the ID/IG ratio is indeed increasing over time. According to the test description, a significant increase in this variance is a proxy for the formation of degradation \"hotspots,\" a process that is incompatible with the long-term stability required to maintain high capacity.",
    "conclusion": true,
    "rationale": "The conclusion is True because the experimental test provided sufficient evidence to support the main hypothesis. The test successfully rejected its null sub-hypothesis, which posited long-term stability. By rejecting the null, the test confirmed the presence of a statistically significant positive trend in spatial surface degradation. As stated in the test description, this observation is a necessary precondition for long-term capacity fade and provides strong evidence for the main hypothesis that the battery's capacity will drop below 80% after 500 cycles."
