Each is a pandas dataframe with columns and example rows:\n\nBattery Raman data: Eg_Amp column available (~475 cm^-1 peak)\n\nFor the final test, return\n(1) Name: name of the test\n(2) Test description: be clear and concise.

Is it redundant on capabilities with existing tests? Is it overlapping with failed tests? Can this be answered and implemented based on the given data? \n(2) reflect: how to improve this test definition. \n\nIf you think the test definition is good enough, return the final test definition to the user. \nIf not, either refine the test definition that is better than the previous one or propose a new test definition, then go to the next round.\n",
      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\n## Initial Falsification Test Proposal\n\n**(1) Name:** Charging-Induced Eg Peak Amplitude Enhancement Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test examines whether the Eg peak amplitude shows a statistically significant positive correlation with charging voltage and achieves the expected ~30% amplitude increase. The test tracks Eg_Amp values across the charging cycle and computes the correlation coefficient with voltage. Falsification occurs if: (a) the correlation is not significantly positive (p > 0.05), or (b) the amplitude increase is significantly less than 30%, or (c) the correlation coefficient is significantly lower than the expected r ~ +0.28.\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** There is no positive correlation between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage (r \u2264 0), OR the amplitude increase during charging is \u2264 15% (half the expected increase), OR the correlation coefficient is significantly lower than +0.28.\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** There is a significant positive correlation between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage (r > 0), AND the amplitude increase is > 15%, AND the correlation coefficient is consistent with the expected r ~ +0.28.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1\n\n**(1) Critic:** \n- **Main hypothesis nullity check:** If the main hypothesis is null (no M-O bending enhancement during charging), then indeed there should be no positive correlation with voltage and no amplitude increase. \u2713\n- **Redundancy:** This is the first test, so no redundancy issues. \u2713\n- **Data availability:** The test requires Eg_Amp and voltage data, which appears to be available. \u2713\n- **Issue:** The null hypothesis is compound (using OR statements) which makes statistical testing complex and potentially ambiguous.\n\n**(2) Reflect:** The test definition needs to be simplified to focus on a single, clear statistical hypothesis. The compound null hypothesis should be restructured to test one primary aspect that most directly addresses the main hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n## Refined Test Proposal\n\n**(1) Name:** Eg Peak Amplitude-Voltage Correlation Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test examines whether the Eg peak amplitude shows a statistically significant positive correlation with charging voltage as predicted by the main hypothesis. The test computes Pearson correlation coefficient between Eg_Amp and voltage across the charging cycle. Falsification occurs if the correlation is not significantly positive (p > 0.05) or if the correlation coefficient is significantly lower than zero, contradicting the expected positive relationship.\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** The correlation coefficient between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage is \u2264 0 (r \u2264 0).\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** The correlation coefficient between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage is > 0 (r > 0).\n\n---\n\n## Round 2\n\n**(1) Critic:**\n- **Main hypothesis nullity check:** If the main hypothesis is null (no enhanced M-O bending during charging), then there should indeed be no positive correlation between Eg amplitude and voltage. \u2713\n- **Redundancy:** Still the first test. \u2713\n- **Data availability:** Requires Eg_Amp and voltage data. \u2713\n- **Statistical clarity:** Now has a clear, single statistical hypothesis that can be tested with standard correlation analysis. \u2713\n- **Strength:** This directly tests the core prediction of the main hypothesis about positive correlation.\n\n**(2) Reflect:** This test definition is now clear, statistically sound, and directly addresses the main hypothesis. It satisfies the falsification criteria properly.\n\n---\n\n## Final Test Definition\n\n**(1) Name:** Eg Peak Amplitude-Voltage Correlation Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test examines whether the Eg peak amplitude shows a statistically significant positive correlation with charging voltage as predicted by the main hypothesis. The test computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between Eg_Amp and voltage across the charging cycle and tests for statistical significance. Falsification occurs if the correlation is not significantly positive (p > 0.05), indicating that lithium extraction does not enhance M-O bending Raman scattering as hypothesized.\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** The correlation coefficient between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage is \u2264 0 (r \u2264 0).\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** The correlation coefficient between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage is > 0 (r > 0)."
