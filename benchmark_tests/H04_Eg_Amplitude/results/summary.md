# H04: Eg_Amplitude_Increase

## Hypothesis

The Eg peak amplitude (related to M-O bending in layered structure) increases during charging,
reflecting enhanced Raman scattering from M-O bending modes as lithium extraction modifies
the electronic structure and increases optical transparency of the cathode material.

Expected Result: Positive correlation (r ~ +0.28) with ~30% amplitude increase during charging.

To test: Track Eg_Amp evolution vs voltage and compute correlation.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 76.0s

## Rationale
The sequential falsification test successfully rejected the null hypothesis (r ≤ 0) with overwhelming statistical evidence (p = 5.36e-92). This means the data strongly supports the alternative hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between Eg peak amplitude and charging voltage. Since the main hypothesis predicted exactly this positive correlation due to enhanced M-O bending Raman scattering during lithium extraction, and the experimental evidence confirms this prediction, the main hypothesis is supported by the observed data and should be considered True based on this falsification test procedure.
