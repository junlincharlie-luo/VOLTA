# H07: A1g_Width_Decrease

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak width (A1g_Sigma) decreases with voltage, indicating peak sharpening as lithium
extraction creates a more uniform local bonding environment and reduces the distribution
of M-O bond lengths.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.63), with ~33% width decrease during charging.

To test: Track A1g_Sigma evolution with voltage and compute correlation.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 80.2s

## Rationale
The falsification test was designed to reject the main hypothesis if no significant negative correlation (or a weak correlation ≥ -0.5) was found. Since the test resulted in a "PASS" with sufficient evidence and an extremely small p-value (6.26e-95), the null hypothesis was rejected. This means the data supports the alternate hypothesis, which is consistent with the main scientific hypothesis. The test failed to falsify the hypothesis, therefore supporting its validity based on the observed experimental evidence.
