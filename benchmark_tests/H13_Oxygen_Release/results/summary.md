# H13: Oxygen_Release

## Hypothesis

Irreversible oxygen evolution from the lattice occurs when voltage exceeds 4.5V during the
first charge activation cycle.

Note: This hypothesis requires oxygen detection data (O2 Raman modes or mass spectrometry).
The current dataset only contains M-O vibration peaks and carbon bands.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 138.8s

## Rationale
The falsification test was specifically designed to detect structural evidence that would be consistent with the main hypothesis. Since the test found significant structural changes in the M-O lattice framework when voltage exceeded 4.5V (as evidenced by the rejection of the null hypothesis), this provides supporting evidence for the main hypothesis rather than falsifying it. The detected structural changes in M-O vibrational characteristics are consistent with what would be expected if irreversible oxygen evolution from the lattice were occurring at voltages above 4.5V.
