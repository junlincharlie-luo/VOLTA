      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\n## Initial Falsification Test Proposal\n\n**(1) Name:** Edge-to-Center A1g Peak Shift Gradient Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test examines whether there is a systematic gradient in A1g peak shifts from the edges toward the center of the 30x30 mapping region. If the main hypothesis is true (homogeneous electrochemical accessibility), then A1g shifts should show no directional trend when moving from edge to center. The falsification outcome would be detecting a significant radial gradient, suggesting non-homogeneous accessibility.\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** There is no systematic radial gradient in A1g peak shifts from edge pixels toward center pixels across the 30x30 electrode mapping region.\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** There exists a significant radial gradient in A1g peak shifts from edge pixels toward center pixels, indicating spatially dependent electrochemical accessibility.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1\n\n**(1) Critic:** \n- **Logical consistency check:** If the main hypothesis is null (edge and center pixels show different A1g evolution), would this gradient test also be null? Yes - if there are differences between edge and center, we would expect to see gradients. \u2713\n- **Redundancy check:** This is the first test, so no redundancy issues. \u2713\n- **Failed test overlap:** No previous failed tests to avoid. \u2713\n- **Data feasibility:** Can be implemented using X,Y coordinates and A1g_Center values from Battery Raman data. \u2713\n\n**(2) Reflect:** The test seems logically sound and implementable. However, I should be more specific about how the gradient will be measured and what constitutes a \"significant\" gradient. The test could be strengthened by defining the radial distance calculation and the statistical method more precisely.\n\n**Refined Test Definition:**\n\n**(1) Name:** Radial Distance-A1g Shift Correlation Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test calculates the radial distance of each pixel from the center of the 30x30 grid and tests for correlation between radial distance and A1g peak shift values. If homogeneous electrochemical accessibility exists, there should be no significant correlation between a pixel's distance from center and its A1g shift. Falsification occurs if a significant correlation is detected (p \u2264 0.05).\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** There is no significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient = 0).\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** There exists a significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient \u2260 0).\n\n---\n\n## Round 2\n\n**(1) Critic:**\n- **Logical consistency check:** If the main hypothesis is null (edge \u2260 center A1g evolution), then we would expect correlation between radial position and A1g shifts. \u2713\n- **Redundancy check:** Still the first test. \u2713\n- **Failed test overlap:** None. \u2713\n- **Data feasibility:** Can calculate radial distance using X,Y coordinates and correlate with A1g_Center. \u2713\n\n**(2) Reflect:** This refined version is more precise and statistically testable. The correlation approach directly addresses spatial homogeneity and is easily implementable. The test is well-defined and should provide clear evidence for or against the main hypothesis.\n\n## Final Test Definition\n\n**(1) Name:** Radial Distance-A1g Shift Correlation Test\n\n**(2) Test description:** This test calculates the radial distance of each pixel from the center of the 30x30 grid and tests for correlation between radial distance and A1g peak shift values. If homogeneous electrochemical accessibility exists, there should be no significant correlation between a pixel's distance from center and its A1g shift. Falsification occurs if a significant correlation is detected (p \u2264 0.05).\n\n**(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** There is no significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient = 0).\n\n**(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** There exists a significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient \u2260 0)."

If no correlation exists, it strongly supports homogeneous accessibility; if correlation is found, it directly refutes the main hypothesis.\n\n3. **High predictive value**: The results have clear interpretability - a significant correlation (p \u2264 0.05) would falsify the homogeneity claim, while no correlation (p > 0.05) would support it. This provides definitive evidence for or against the main hypothesis.\n\n4. **Methodological alignment**: The test uses the same spatial scale (30x30 mapping region) and the same measurement parameter (A1g peak shift) as specified in the main hypothesis, ensuring direct comparability.\n\n5. **Comprehensive spatial analysis**: Rather than just comparing edge vs. center (binary comparison), this test examines the full spatial gradient, providing more nuanced and complete information about electrochemical accessibility patterns across the entire mapped area.\n\nThe falsification test design is particularly strong because it can definitively support or refute the homogeneity claim with clear statistical criteria."

If homogeneous electrochemical accessibility exists, there should be no significant correlation between a pixel's distance from center and its A1g shift. Falsification occurs if a significant correlation is detected (p \u2264 0.05). \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient = 0). \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There exists a significant correlation between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values (correlation coefficient \u2260 0). \n test statistics: 5.28e-61\n\n Sequential testing result: sufficient evidence - PASS with statistics E-value current combined e-value using kappa p-to-e calibrator: 6.881023532039754e+29 \n Number of total tests done: 1",
      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nBased on the observed sequential falsification test procedure:\n\n## (1) Main Scientific Hypothesis Under Study\nThe hypothesis states that pixels at the edges of the 30x30 mapping region exhibit statistically similar A1g peak evolution compared to center pixels, indicating homogeneous electrochemical accessibility across the mapped electrode area at the 30 \u03bcm scale.\n\n## (2) Result of the Sequential Falsification Test\nThe sequential falsification test **PASSED** with sufficient evidence. The test achieved a p-value of 5.28e-61 and an extremely large E-value of 6.881023532039754e+29 using the kappa p-to-e calibrator.\n\n## (3) Reasoning and Analysis\nThe Radial Distance-A1g Shift Correlation Test was designed to detect any systematic variation in A1g peak shifts as a function of distance from the center of the mapping region. The test examined whether pixels farther from the center showed different electrochemical behavior compared to those near the center.\n\nThe extremely small p-value (5.28e-61) indicates a highly significant correlation between radial distance and A1g peak shift values. This means there is strong statistical evidence that the A1g peak shifts are not uniform across the mapped region - pixels at different distances from the center exhibit systematically different behavior.\n\nThe large E-value confirms that this result provides substantial evidence against the null hypothesis of no correlation, indicating that the electrochemical accessibility is indeed heterogeneous rather than homogeneous across the 30 \u03bcm scale mapping area.\n\n## (4) Conclusion\n**False**\n\n## (5) Rationale of the Conclusion\nThe hypothesis claimed homogeneous electrochemical accessibility across the mapped electrode area, which would manifest as no significant difference between edge and center pixels. However, the falsification test detected a highly significant correlation (p = 5.28e-61) between radial distance from center and A1g peak shift values. This correlation directly contradicts the hypothesis of homogeneous behavior, providing strong evidence that electrochemical accessibility varies systematically across the mapped region. Therefore, the hypothesis must be rejected as false based on the experimental evidence."
