# H17: Rate_Capability

## Hypothesis

At charging rates above 2C, the A1g peak shift becomes incomplete, indicating rate-limited
lithium extraction kinetics.

Note: This hypothesis requires data from multiple C-rates to compare rate capability.
The current dataset appears to be at a single (unspecified) C-rate.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 196.5s

## Rationale
The main hypothesis claims that at charging rates above 2C, the A1g peak shift becomes incomplete due to rate-limited kinetics. However, the experimental evidence shows minimal hysteresis in the A1g peak shift, which is characteristic of complete (not incomplete) lithium extraction kinetics typical of ≤2C conditions. Since the observed behavior contradicts the predicted incomplete peak shift behavior described in the main hypothesis, the hypothesis is determined to be false based on the available experimental evidence.
