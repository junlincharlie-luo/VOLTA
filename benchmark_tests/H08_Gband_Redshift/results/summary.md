# H08: Gband_Redshift

## Hypothesis

The G-band center position shifts to lower wavenumbers (redshifts) with increasing voltage,
reflecting charge transfer interactions between the carbon conductive network and the
delithiating cathode particles, or electrochemical doping effects on the carbon.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.74), with G-band shifting ~3.5 cm^-1 per volt.

To test: Calculate G_Center shift range and correlation with voltage.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 105.6s

## Rationale
The falsification test failed to falsify the main hypothesis. With a test statistic of 2.23e-308 (indicating p < 0.001), there is overwhelming statistical evidence for a significant negative correlation between G-band center position and voltage. The sequential testing procedure passed with sufficient evidence, meaning the data supports the predicted charge transfer mechanism. Since the falsification attempt was unsuccessful - the null hypothesis of no negative correlation was decisively rejected - the main hypothesis regarding G-band redshift with increasing voltage due to charge transfer interactions remains supported by the experimental evidence.
