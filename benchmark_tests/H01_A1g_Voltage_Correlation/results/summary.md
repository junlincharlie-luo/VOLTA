# H01: A1g_Voltage_Correlation

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak center position (cm^-1) decreases (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging,
reflecting delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening in Li-rich layered oxides due to oxygen redox
participation and structural distortion.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.88), with A1g peak shifting ~22 cm^-1 lower
during charging from 3.05V to 4.68V.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 90.7 seconds

## Rationale
The falsification test failed to falsify the main hypothesis. The statistical evidence strongly supports that the A1g peak center position decreases (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging, which is exactly what the hypothesis predicted. The test statistic of 1.1e-177 provides overwhelming evidence against the null hypothesis of no redshift, thereby supporting the alternate hypothesis that redshift occurs. Since the falsification attempt was unsuccessful (the test PASSED), the main hypothesis remains supported by the experimental evidence.
