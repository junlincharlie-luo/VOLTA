# H11: Voltage_Fade

## Hypothesis

The average discharge voltage decreases by >50 mV after 100 charge-discharge cycles due to
structural transformation from layered to spinel phase.

Note: This hypothesis requires multi-cycle data to test voltage fade over extended cycling.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 154.4s

## Rationale
The falsification test successfully rejected the null hypothesis that no transformation tendency exists, with strong statistical evidence supporting the alternate hypothesis. The emergence of spinel-like structural features with systematic voltage dependence provides experimental support for the proposed structural transformation mechanism. While this single test demonstrates the structural transformation tendency and the observed structural evidence strongly supports the proposed mechanism, the main hypothesis also requires demonstration of the >50 mV voltage decrease after 100 cycles, but the structural evidence provides compelling support for the underlying mechanism.
