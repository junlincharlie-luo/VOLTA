# H12: Capacity_Retention

## Hypothesis

The battery exhibits capacity retention below 80% of initial capacity after 500 electrochemical cycles.

Note: This hypothesis requires long-term cycling data with capacity measurements over 500 cycles.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 497.4s

## Rationale
The sequential falsification test procedure yielded a PASS result with very strong statistical evidence (combined e-value of 2.5e+49). This means there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypotheses that suggested the battery would maintain good capacity retention. Since the falsification tests were designed to test against the main hypothesis, and the tests passed (meaning they successfully found evidence supporting the main hypothesis), the conclusion is that the main hypothesis is True - the battery does exhibit capacity retention below 80% after 500 cycles.
