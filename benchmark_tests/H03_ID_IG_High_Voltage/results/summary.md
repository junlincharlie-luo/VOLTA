# H03: ID_IG_High_Voltage

## Hypothesis

The ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,
indicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical
activation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.

Expected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation
(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.

To test: Compare mean ID_IG_Ratio at voltage bins <4.3V vs >4.3V using statistical tests.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 133.4s

## Rationale
The falsification test failed to falsify the main hypothesis. The statistical evidence strongly supports the predicted negative correlation between voltage and ID/IG ratio. With a p-value of 1e-300 and an E-value of 5e+149, there is overwhelming evidence that higher voltages are associated with lower ID/IG ratios, which aligns with the hypothesis that electrochemical activation at high potentials enhances graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement in the carbon conductive network.
