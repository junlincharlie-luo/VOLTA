# H15: Cation_Mixing

## Hypothesis

Ni2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,
detectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.

Note: This hypothesis requires multi-cycle data to track cation mixing evolution.
The current dataset contains only a single charge cycle.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 239.2s

## Rationale
While the prerequisite test passed and demonstrated that the Eg/A1g ratio is sensitive to electrochemical changes, the main hypothesis cannot be validated as true because: (1) The hypothesis specifically requires multi-cycle data to track cation mixing evolution, (2) The current dataset contains only a single charge cycle, (3) The test only validated a necessary but not sufficient condition for the hypothesis, and (4) No direct evidence was provided for the core claim of progressive increase with cycle number. Therefore, despite the strong statistical evidence for electrochemical sensitivity, the main hypothesis remains unproven due to insufficient data scope
