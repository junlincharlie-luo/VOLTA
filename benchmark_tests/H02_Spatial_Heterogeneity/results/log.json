      "================================ Human Message =================================\n\n\nGiven a biology hypothesis \"\nThe standard deviation of A1g_Center across the 900 spatial pixels increases as voltage increases,\nindicating growing electrochemical heterogeneity during delithiation.\n\nTo test: Calculate spatial variance/std of A1g_Center at each time step and correlate with voltage.\n\", your goal is to propose a novel falsification test given the available biology data sources. \nA falsification test is a test that can potentially falsify the main hypothesis. \nThe outcome of the falsification test is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.\n\nNotably, the falsification test should satisfy the following property: if the main hypotheiss is null, then the falsification sub-hypothesis should also be null. \n\nHere are the list of available data sources, and you can directly call the dataframe as it has already been loaded; no need to load from file path. Each is a pandas dataframe with columns and example rows:\n\nBattery Raman data with 900 pixels, 114 time steps, voltage 3.05-4.68V\n\nFor the final test, return\n(1) Name: name of the test\n(2) Test description: be clear and concise. Describe the falsification outcomes.\n(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: what is the statistical null sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?\n(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: what is the statistical alternative sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?\n\nHere are the falsification tests that you've created in the previous rounds and their corresponding test results:\n\n\"\"\"\nNo Implemented Falsification Test Yet.\n\"\"\"\n\nYou may use these information to formulate your next subhypothesis and falsification test, but make sure the proposed falsification test is non-redundant with any of the existing tests.\n\nThe proposed test should also avoid these failed falsification tests in the previous rounds:\n\n\"\"\"\n[]\n\"\"\"\n\nA good falsification test should serve as a strong evidence for the main hypothesis. However, make sure it is answerable with the given available data sources.\nYou should aim to maximize the implication strength of the proposed falsification test using the relevant parts of the provided data.\n\n---- \nFirst produce an initial falsification test proposal.\n\nThen, in each round i, you will do the following:\n(1) critic: ask if the main hypothesis is null, is this test also null? be rigorous. this is super important, otherwise, the test is invalid. Is it redundant on capabilities with existing tests? Is it overlapping with failed tests? Can this be answered and implemented based on the given data? \n(2) reflect: how to improve this test definition. \n\nIf you think the test definition is good enough, return the final test definition to the user. \nIf not, either refine the test definition that is better than the previous one or propose a new test definition, then go to the next round.\n",

It uses the exact same metric (spatial standard deviation across 900 pixels) and independent variable (voltage) as specified in the main hypothesis.\n\n2. **Strong evidence strength**: The voltage-stratified approach provides a robust statistical framework to test the directional relationship proposed in the main hypothesis.

Conversely, if p > 0.05, it provides direct evidence against the hypothesis, as stated in the test description.\n\n4. **Appropriate falsification design**: The test is designed as a proper falsification test with clear null and alternative hypotheses that map directly onto the main hypothesis claims.

The test achieved a combined e-value of 2,921,031,189.18 using the kappa p-to-e calibrator, indicating very strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\n### (3) Reasoning and Analysis\nThe Voltage-Stratified Spatial Heterogeneity Test was designed to directly challenge the main hypothesis by comparing spatial heterogeneity between low voltage (3.05-3.8V) and high voltage (3.8-4.68V) strata. The test:\n\n- Calculated spatial standard deviation of A1g_Center across 900 pixels for each time step\n- Computed mean spatial standard deviation within each voltage stratum  \n- Performed a one-tailed two-sample t-test comparing high vs. low voltage strata\n- Generated an extremely small test statistic (2.93e-20), indicating virtually no probability that the observed difference occurred by chance\n- The resulting e-value of over 2.9 billion provides overwhelming evidence against the null hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity is equal between voltage strata\n\n### (4) Conclusion\n**True**\n\n### (5) Rationale of the Conclusion\nThe falsification test failed to falsify the main hypothesis. The test was specifically designed to find evidence against the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity increases with voltage. However, the results showed overwhelming statistical evidence (p \u2248 2.93e-20) that the high voltage stratum does indeed have significantly greater spatial heterogeneity than the low voltage stratum. Since the falsification attempt failed with such strong contradictory evidence, and no other tests were performed that successfully falsified the hypothesis, the main hypothesis remains supported and is concluded to be True."

  "last_message": "## Summary of Sequential Falsification Test\n\n### (1) Main Scientific Hypothesis Under Study\nThe standard deviation of A1g_Center across the 900 spatial pixels increases as voltage increases, indicating growing electrochemical heterogeneity during delithiation.\n\n### (2) Result of the Sequential Falsification Test\nThe sequential falsification test **PASSED** with sufficient evidence. The test achieved a combined e-value of 2,921,031,189.18 using the kappa p-to-e calibrator, indicating very strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\n### (3) Reasoning and Analysis\nThe Voltage-Stratified Spatial Heterogeneity Test was designed to directly challenge the main hypothesis by comparing spatial heterogeneity between low voltage (3.05-3.8V) and high voltage (3.8-4.68V) strata. The test:\n\n- Calculated spatial standard deviation of A1g_Center across 900 pixels for each time step\n- Computed mean spatial standard deviation within each voltage stratum  \n- Performed a one-tailed two-sample t-test comparing high vs. low voltage strata\n- Generated an extremely small test statistic (2.93e-20), indicating virtually no probability that the observed difference occurred by chance\n- The resulting e-value of over 2.9 billion provides overwhelming evidence against the null hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity is equal between voltage strata\n\n### (4) Conclusion\n**True**\n\n### (5) Rationale of the Conclusion\nThe falsification test failed to falsify the main hypothesis. The test was specifically designed to find evidence against the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity increases with voltage. However, the results showed overwhelming statistical evidence (p \u2248 2.93e-20) that the high voltage stratum does indeed have significantly greater spatial heterogeneity than the low voltage stratum. Since the falsification attempt failed with such strong contradictory evidence, and no other tests were performed that successfully falsified the hypothesis, the main hypothesis remains supported and is concluded to be True.",
