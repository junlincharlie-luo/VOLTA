# H16: CEI_Steady_State

## Hypothesis

The cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layer thickness stabilizes after approximately 50 cycles,
as indicated by saturation of D-band intensity changes.

Note: This hypothesis requires multi-cycle data (50+ cycles) to assess CEI evolution.
The current dataset contains only a single charge cycle.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 189.6s

## Rationale
While the test passed and demonstrated that D-band measurements have adequate precision, this result does not validate the main hypothesis. The main hypothesis specifically claims that CEI layer thickness stabilizes after approximately 50 cycles as indicated by D-band intensity saturation. This claim cannot be tested or verified with only single-cycle data. The test only confirmed a necessary technical prerequisite (measurement precision) but did not provide any evidence about the actual 50-cycle stabilization pattern that forms the core of the main hypothesis. Without multi-cycle data spanning 50+ cycles, the main hypothesis remains untested and therefore cannot be considered true based on the available evidence.
