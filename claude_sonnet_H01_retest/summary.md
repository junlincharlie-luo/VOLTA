# H01: A1g_Voltage_Correlation (Retest)

**Model**: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak center position (cm^-1) decreases (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging,
reflecting delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening in Li-rich layered oxides due to oxygen redox
participation and structural distortion.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.88), with A1g peak shifting ~22 cm^-1 lower
during charging from 3.05V to 4.68V.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 793.4 seconds

## Rationale
Despite the sequential testing procedure not yet reaching a definitive stopping criterion, all five falsification tests failed to reject their respective null hypotheses. The consistent failure to demonstrate strong negative correlations across half-cycles, consistent directional shifts, linear relationships, predicted correlation strengths, and expected shift magnitudes indicates that the experimental data does not support the main hypothesis. The lack of statistical significance across multiple independent tests examining different facets of the same underlying claim provides insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis as stated.
