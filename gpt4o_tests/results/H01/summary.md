# H01: A1g_Voltage_Correlation

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak center position (cm^-1) decreases (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging,
reflecting delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening in Li-rich layered oxides due to oxygen redox
participation and structural distortion.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.88), with A1g peak shifting ~22 cm^-1 lower
during charging from 3.05V to 4.68V.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 159.3 seconds

## Rationale
The falsification test provided significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis of voltage independence, supporting the main hypothesis that the A1g peak center position decreases with increasing voltage. The strong correlation and E-value support the hypothesis that delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening and structural distortion affect the A1g peak during charging.
