# H07: A1g_Width

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak width (A1g_Sigma, representing the Gaussian/Lorentzian width parameter)
decreases during charging as voltage increases from 3.05V to 4.68V.

Peak sharpening during delithiation indicates a more uniform local bonding environment
as lithium is extracted systematically from the layered structure.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.63) between A1g_Sigma and Voltage,
with approximately 33% decrease in peak width during the full charge cycle.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 45.4 seconds

## Rationale
The rejection of the null sub-hypothesis suggests a significant correlation between A1g_Sigma and time, independent of voltage changes. This means other factors beyond voltage could influence A1g_Sigma, challenging the main hypothesis that A1g_Sigma decreases primarily due to voltage changes during charging. Therefore, the main hypothesis is not supported by the falsification test.
