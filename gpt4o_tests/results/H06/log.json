      "================================ Human Message =================================\n\n\nGiven a biology hypothesis \"\nEdge and center pixels in the 30x30 spatial mapping grid show uniform electrochemical\nbehavior during charging.\n\nPixels located at the edges of the electrode region should exhibit statistically similar\nA1g peak position evolution compared to pixels in the center region. This tests whether\nthere are edge effects or current distribution non-uniformities.\n\nExpected Result: No statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) in A1g_Center shift\nmagnitude or rate between edge pixels and center pixels during charging.\n\", your goal is to propose a novel falsification test given the available biology data sources. \nA falsification test is a test that can potentially falsify the main hypothesis. \nThe outcome of the falsification test is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.\n\nNotably, the falsification test should satisfy the following property: if the main hypotheiss is null, then the falsification sub-hypothesis should also be null. \n\nHere are the list of available data sources, and you can directly call the dataframe as it has already been loaded; no need to load from file path. Each is a pandas dataframe with columns and example rows:\n\n\nBattery Operando Raman Spectroscopy Data:\n- Material: Li1.13Ni0.3Mn0.57O2 (Li-rich layered oxide)\n- 900 spatial pixels (30x30 grid), 114 time steps\n- Voltage range: 3.05V to 4.68V (single charge cycle)\n- Key columns: A1g_Center, X, Y, Voltage, time_idx\n- X, Y coordinates: 0-29 range for 30x30 grid\n- Edge pixels: X or Y in {0, 29}; Center pixels: X and Y in {10-19}\n\n\nFor the final test, return\n(1) Name: name of the test\n(2) Test description: be clear and concise. Describe the falsification outcomes.\n(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: what is the statistical null sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?\n(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: what is the statistical alternative sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?\n\nHere are the falsification tests that you've created in the previous rounds and their corresponding test results:\n\n\"\"\"\nNo Implemented Falsification Test Yet.\n\"\"\"\n\nYou may use these information to formulate your next subhypothesis and falsification test, but make sure the proposed falsification test is non-redundant with any of the existing tests.\n\nThe proposed test should also avoid these failed falsification tests in the previous rounds:\n\n\"\"\"\n[]\n\"\"\"\n\nA good falsification test should serve as a strong evidence for the main hypothesis. However, make sure it is answerable with the given available data sources.\nYou should aim to maximize the implication strength of the proposed falsification test using the relevant parts of the provided data.\n\n---- \nFirst produce an initial falsification test proposal.\n\nThen, in each round i, you will do the following:\n(1) critic: ask if the main hypothesis is null, is this test also null? be rigorous. this is super important, otherwise, the test is invalid. Is it redundant on capabilities with existing tests? Is it overlapping with failed tests? Can this be answered and implemented based on the given data? \n(2) reflect: how to improve this test definition. \n\nIf you think the test definition is good enough, return the final test definition to the user. \nIf not, either refine the test definition that is better than the previous one or propose a new test definition, then go to the next round.\n",
      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\n### Initial Falsification Test Proposal\n\n**(1) Name:** Voltage Influence Test on A1g_Center Shift\n\n**(2) Test Description:**\nThe test aims to evaluate whether the voltage level has a differential impact on the A1g peak position evolution for edge pixels compared to center pixels during charging. By analyzing the A1g_Center shift across different voltage levels for both edge and center pixels, we can determine if there is a statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge vs. center) and voltage level on the A1g_Center shift.\n\n**(3) Null Sub-Hypothesis \\( h_0 \\):**\nThere is no statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge or center) and voltage levels on the A1g_Center shift during charging.\n\n**(4) Alternate Sub-Hypothesis \\( h_1 \\):**\nThere is a statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge or center) and voltage levels on the A1g_Center shift during charging.\n\n### Round 1: Critique and Reflection\n\n**(1) Critic:**\n- **Null Hypothesis Relationship:** If the main hypothesis is null (no difference between edge and center pixels), this test should also be null, as it specifically looks for interaction effects that would imply differences based on location.\n- **Redundancy and Overlap:** This test is not redundant with existing tests since none have been implemented yet, nor does it overlap with failed tests.\n- **Data Applicability:** The test can be answered with the available data since it uses A1g_Center, Voltage, X, and Y columns, which are present in the dataset.\n\n**(2) Reflect:**\nThe test seems well-defined and applicable given the current dataset. It efficiently uses the available data to explore a potential interaction effect that would falsify the main hypothesis if present. The test's focus on interaction effects strengthens its ability to provide evidence for or against the main hypothesis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proposed test is robust, non-redundant, and appropriate for the dataset. It can potentially falsify the main hypothesis by examining interaction effects between voltage levels and pixel location on the A1g_Center shift.\n\n**Final Test Definition:**\n\n**(1) Name:** Voltage Influence Test on A1g_Center Shift\n\n**(2) Test Description:**\nThe test evaluates whether voltage levels have a differential impact on the A1g peak position evolution for edge pixels compared to center pixels during charging. By analyzing the A1g_Center shift across different voltage levels for both edge and center pixels, we can determine if there is a statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge vs. center) and voltage level on the A1g_Center shift.\n\n**(3) Null Sub-Hypothesis \\( h_0 \\):**\nThere is no statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge or center) and voltage levels on the A1g_Center shift during charging.\n\n**(4) Alternate Sub-Hypothesis \\( h_1 \\):**\nThere is a statistically significant interaction effect between pixel location (edge or center) and voltage levels on the A1g_Center shift during charging."

The main hypothesis posits uniform electrochemical behavior during charging, specifically concerning the A1g peak shift between edge and center pixels. If voltage levels are found to influence the A1g peak shift differently based on pixel location, it could suggest that uniform behavior is disrupted by voltage effects, thereby refuting the main hypothesis. Thus, this test addresses a major component of the main hypothesis by examining potential interaction effects that could explain non-uniformity in behavior. The test provides substantial supporting or refuting evidence and shows strong mechanistic alignment, as voltage effects are a plausible mechanism for non-uniform electrochemical behavior."
