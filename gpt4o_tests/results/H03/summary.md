# H03: ID_IG_High_Voltage

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator from D-band and G-band Raman peaks) decreases
significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V during charging.

This indicates enhanced graphitic ordering in the carbon additive at high states of charge,
possibly due to electrochemical stress or charge transfer effects between the carbon
network and the delithiating cathode.

Expected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID_IG_Ratio when comparing V < 4.3V vs V > 4.3V,
with an overall negative correlation (r ~ -0.21) between ID_IG_Ratio and Voltage.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 433.0 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests provided sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. The Graphitic Ordering Threshold Sensitivity Test indicated significant differences in the ID/IG ratio's response to voltage changes above and below 4.3V, supporting the idea of enhanced graphitic ordering. Despite the first test not finding a significant correlation, the overall combined result was strong enough to pass the hypothesis with a high E-value, leading to the conclusion that the hypothesis is true.
