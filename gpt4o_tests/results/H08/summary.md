# H08: Gband_Redshift

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The G-band center position (at ~1585 cm^-1, representing graphitic carbon sp2 vibrations)
shifts to lower wavenumbers (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging.

This redshift reflects charge transfer between the carbon conductive network and the
delithiating cathode particles, as well as potential stress effects from volume changes.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.74) between G_Center and Voltage,
with the G-band shifting approximately 3.5 cm^-1 per volt of charging.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 118.3 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests provided sufficient evidence to challenge the main hypothesis. The results from both tests suggest that factors other than voltage changes, particularly stress effects, play a significant role in the G-band center position shifts. The lack of a strong negative correlation between G-band position and voltage and the significant correlation with stress effects independently imply that the hypothesis, as initially stated, is not true.
