# H04: Eg_Amplitude

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The Eg peak amplitude (at ~475 cm^-1, representing M-O bending vibrations) increases
during charging as voltage increases from 3.05V to 4.68V.

This reflects enhanced Raman scattering from M-O bending modes as lithium is extracted
from the layered oxide structure, changing the local bonding environment and symmetry.

Expected Result: Positive correlation (r ~ +0.28) between Eg_Amp and Voltage,
with approximately 30% amplitude increase during the full charge cycle.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 75.5 seconds

## Rationale
The test results indicate that the increase in Eg peak amplitude is not uniformly distributed across spatial pixels, suggesting localized phenomena rather than a general increase due to voltage changes and lithium extraction. This challenges the main hypothesis that the amplitude increase is primarily due to voltage changes, leading to its falsification.
