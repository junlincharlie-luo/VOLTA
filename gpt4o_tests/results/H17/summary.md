# H17: Rate_Capability

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

Rate capability degrades at C-rates above 2C: The A1g peak shift becomes
incomplete at high C-rates, indicating rate-limited lithium extraction.

At high charging rates, lithium extraction kinetics cannot keep up with the
applied current, resulting in incomplete structural changes as observed
by reduced A1g peak shift magnitude.

NOTE: This hypothesis requires Raman measurements at multiple C-rates
(e.g., C/10, C/2, 1C, 2C, 5C). The current dataset was collected at a
single C-rate and contains no rate-capability comparison data.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 281.7 seconds

## Rationale
The results of the test provided insufficient evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis, which means that the hypothesis that rate capability degrades at C-rates above 2C due to incomplete A1g peak shifts is not supported by the current data. The sequential testing result indicates that further tests are needed, but at this stage, the evidence is not strong enough to validate the main hypothesis.
