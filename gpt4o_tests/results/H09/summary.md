# H09: Dband_Time_Delay

**Model**: GPT-4o

## Hypothesis

The D-band amplitude (D_Amp, representing disordered carbon) shows a time-delayed
response to voltage changes during charging.

Changes in D_Amp lag behind voltage changes by at least one measurement interval
(approximately 15 minutes), suggesting kinetically slow processes such as SEI
(solid-electrolyte interphase) formation or restructuring.

Expected Result: Cross-correlation analysis between voltage derivative and D_Amp
derivative should show maximum correlation at a positive time lag (D_Amp lagging voltage).


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 436.1 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential testing result indicated insufficient evidence to conclusively support the hypothesis, as the combined e-value exceeds 1, suggesting that the hypothesis is not strongly supported by the tests conducted. Although some tests align with the hypothesis, the overall evidence from the combined tests does not provide enough statistical support to accept the hypothesis as true.
