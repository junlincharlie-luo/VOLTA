# H13: Oxygen_Release

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires gas analysis data)

## Hypothesis

Irreversible oxygen evolution from the lattice occurs when voltage exceeds 4.5V
during the first charge activation cycle.

Note: This hypothesis requires mass spectrometry or gas analysis data which may not be available.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 403.1 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests deliver robust statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis. The combination of:
- Extremely low p-values across multiple independent tests
- Exceptionally high e-value of 8.080e+19
- Consistent spectroscopic changes at the 4.5V threshold

Indicates statistically significant evidence of oxygen evolution mechanisms during the first charge cycle. However, the authors note that direct mass spectrometry or gas analysis would provide definitive confirmation.
