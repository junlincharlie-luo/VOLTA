# H03: ID_IG_High_Voltage

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

The ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,
indicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical
activation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.

Expected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V compared to lower voltages.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 308.4 seconds

## Rationale
The experimental evidence strongly supports the scientific hypothesis through:
- Extremely low test statistics demonstrating statistically significant deviations
- A rigorous sequential testing methodology
- A high combined e-value of 14,998,590.19877886 providing strong scientific confidence
- Clear demonstration of spatial and electrochemical variations in the ID/IG ratio at voltages exceeding 4.3V
- Confirmation of enhanced graphitic ordering at high potentials
