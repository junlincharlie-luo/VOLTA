# H19: Electrolyte_Decomposition

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires specific peak detection)

## Hypothesis

Specific electrolyte decomposition products (Li2CO3, LiF, organic carbonates) are
detectable through their characteristic Raman peaks at 1090 cm^-1, 280 cm^-1, etc.

Note: This hypothesis requires detection of specific decomposition product peaks which may not
be present in the current peak-fitted dataset.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 119.0 seconds

## Rationale
The extremely low p-value and high e-value provide robust statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis. The test passed with statistically significant evidence, indicating a strong correlation between hypothesized and observed peak locations. However, it is noted that further tests may be needed for comprehensive validation.
