# H02: Spatial_Heterogeneity

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

The standard deviation of A1g_Center across the 900 spatial pixels increases as voltage increases,
indicating growing electrochemical heterogeneity during delithiation.

Expected Result: Positive correlation between voltage and spatial standard deviation of A1g_Center.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 522.1 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests provide overwhelming statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis. The extremely high combined E-value (4.730e+56) indicates robust confirmation across multiple independent testing methods. Consistent results across different statistical approaches (randomness, autocorrelation, gradient, and spectral coherence tests) strongly validate the hypothesis of increasing electrochemical heterogeneity during delithiation.
