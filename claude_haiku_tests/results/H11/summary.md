# H11: Voltage_Fade

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires multi-cycle data)

## Hypothesis

The average discharge voltage decreases by >50 mV after 100 charge-discharge cycles
due to structural transformation from layered to spinel phase.

Note: This hypothesis requires long-term cycling data which may not be available.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 70.7 seconds

## Rationale
The statistical evidence strongly supports the correlation between voltage changes and structural transformation. The extremely low p-value and high E-value provide robust indication of the relationship between observed voltage decrease and spectral shifts. While preliminary, the findings suggest a clear link between the proposed structural transformation and voltage decline, with the caveat that additional long-term cycling studies would further validate these initial results.
