# H08: Gband_Redshift

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

The G-band center position shifts to lower wavenumbers (redshifts) with increasing voltage,
reflecting charge transfer interactions between the carbon conductive network and the delithiating
cathode particles, or electrochemical doping effects on the carbon.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.74) between G_Center and Voltage.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 224.5 seconds

## Rationale
The test successfully passed without finding significant spatial variations in the voltage-G_Center correlation. This supports the main hypothesis that the G-band center position consistently shifts with voltage across different spatial locations, indicating a robust charge transfer or electrochemical doping mechanism in the carbon network.
