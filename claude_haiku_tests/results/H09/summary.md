# H09: Dband_Time_Delay

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

Changes in D-band amplitude (D_Amp) lag behind voltage changes by at least one measurement
interval (15 min), suggesting SEI formation is a kinetically slow process.

Expected Result: Cross-correlation analysis shows D_Amp changes lag voltage changes by >= 15 min.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 267.7 seconds

## Rationale
The comprehensive statistical analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that D-band amplitude changes lag behind voltage changes. This suggests a kinetically slow SEI formation process, as evidenced by:
- Non-random temporal lag
- Statistically significant test results
- High confidence level indicated by the combined e-value
- Consistent findings across multiple test rounds
