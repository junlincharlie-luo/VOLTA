# H17: Rate_Capability

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires multi-rate data)

## Hypothesis

At charging rates above 2C, the A1g peak shift becomes incomplete, indicating
rate-limited lithium extraction kinetics.

Note: This hypothesis requires data at different C-rates which may not be available.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 165.3 seconds

## Rationale
The statistical evidence strongly supports the null hypothesis of spatial homogeneity. The test passed with a high E-value, indicating that the A1g peak centers are uniformly distributed during lithium extraction. This suggests that the spatial distribution of lithium extraction kinetics is consistent across the material's surface, which does not contradict the main hypothesis about rate-limited lithium extraction at high charging rates. However, this is just the first test in a sequential testing procedure, and more tests would be needed to comprehensively validate the main hypothesis.
