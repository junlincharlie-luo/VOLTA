The extremely low p-values and the high combined e-value (42,812,236.28) indicate that the hypothesis successfully withstood multiple rigorous testing approaches. The tests consistently failed to reject the null hypotheses, suggesting that the A1g peak center position indeed shows a consistent redshift during charging, which supports the proposed mechanism of delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening through oxygen redox participation.\n\nThe comprehensive testing across spatial, temporal, intensity, and compositional dimensions provides robust validation of the proposed scientific mechanism in Li-rich layered oxides.\n\nConclusion: True\nElapsed time: 445.4 seconds\nResults saved to: /Users/carrot/Desktop/VOLTA/claude_haiku_tests/results/H01\n"
