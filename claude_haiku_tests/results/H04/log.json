      "Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: \n Proposal: Main hypothesis: \nThe Eg peak amplitude (related to M-O bending in layered structure) increases during charging,\nreflecting enhanced Raman scattering from M-O bending modes as lithium extraction modifies\nthe electronic structure.\n\nExpected Result: Positive correlation (r ~ +0.28) with ~30% amplitude increase during charging.\n \n Falsification Test name: Voltage-Dependent Peak Amplitude Variance Test \n Falsification Test description: Analyze the variance of Eg peak amplitude across different voltage levels to determine if the amplitude changes are statistically significant and consistent with the expected 30% increase during battery charging. The test will use Levene's test for homogeneity of variance to assess whether the peak amplitude variance differs significantly across predefined voltage level groups. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The variance of Eg peak amplitude across different voltage levels does not significantly differ from what would be expected by random variation, with no systematic change related to battery charging state. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The variance of Eg peak amplitude shows a statistically significant increase that is consistent with the proposed 30% amplitude change during battery charging, indicating a systematic relationship between voltage levels and peak amplitude variability. \nRelevance score 0.8 \nReasoning: The Voltage-Dependent Peak Amplitude Variance Test is highly relevant to the main hypothesis for several key reasons:\n\n1. Direct Mechanistic Alignment: The test directly addresses the main hypothesis by examining the Eg peak amplitude changes during battery charging, which is the core claim of the original hypothesis about M-O bending modes and lithium extraction.\n\n2. Quantitative Validation: The test aims to statistically validate the expected 30% amplitude increase, providing a rigorous method to confirm the proposed relationship between voltage levels and peak amplitude.\n\n3. Statistical Rigor: By using Levene's test for variance homogeneity, the sub-hypothesis goes beyond simple correlation and seeks to establish the statistical significance of the amplitude changes.\n\n4. Predictive Value: The test can either support or potentially falsify the main hypothesis by objectively assessing whether the peak amplitude variance is consistent with the proposed mechanism of lithium extraction modifying electronic structure.\n\nThe high relevance score of 0.8 reflects the test's strong potential to provide meaningful insights into the main hypothesis, offering a robust statistical approach to validate the proposed relationship between battery charging and Eg peak amplitude."
