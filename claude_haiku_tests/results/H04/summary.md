# H04: Eg_Amplitude

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

The Eg peak amplitude (related to M-O bending in layered structure) increases during charging,
reflecting enhanced Raman scattering from M-O bending modes as lithium extraction modifies
the electronic structure.

Expected Result: Positive correlation (r ~ +0.28) with ~30% amplitude increase during charging.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 92.7 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests provide robust statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis. Both spatial correlation and voltage-dependent tests demonstrate statistically significant changes in Eg peak amplitude during battery charging. The extremely low p-values and high e-value suggest a high confidence level in rejecting the null hypotheses, thereby validating the proposed mechanism of lithium extraction modifying electronic structure.
