# H05: Spatial_Decoupling

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak position (cathode structural indicator) and ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator)
show weak or no spatial correlation, indicating that local cathode delithiation and carbon network
properties evolve independently across the electrode surface.

Expected Result: Weak mean correlation (|r| < 0.05) between A1g_Center and ID_IG_Ratio.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: True
- **Elapsed Time**: 57.2 seconds

## Rationale
Experimental evidence strongly supports the original hypothesis of weak spatial correlation between A1g peak position and ID/IG ratio. The low test statistic and high E-value suggest that local cathode delithiation and carbon network properties evolve independently across the electrode surface
