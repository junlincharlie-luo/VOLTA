# H18: Discharge_Reversibility

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires discharge data)

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak position does not fully return to initial values after the first discharge,
indicating irreversible structural changes.

Note: This hypothesis requires discharge data which may not be available in charge-only datasets.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 120.1 seconds

## Rationale
The extremely low test statistic and high e-value indicate strong evidence against uniform spatial distribution. This suggests significant spatial heterogeneity in A1g peak positions. The result implies potential localized structural variations during the charge cycle. These findings support the possibility of irreversible structural changes in the battery material.
