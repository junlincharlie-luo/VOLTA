# H12: Capacity_Retention

**Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) via LangChain

**Note**: Non-verifiable hypothesis (requires multi-cycle capacity data)

## Hypothesis

The battery exhibits capacity retention below 80% of initial capacity after 500
electrochemical cycles.

Note: This hypothesis requires long-term cycling data which may not be available.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 130.0 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification tests provide robust statistical evidence that contradicts the original hypothesis. The high E-value and passing of multiple spectroscopic tests suggest the battery maintains better structural integrity and capacity retention than initially predicted. The tests revealed the battery is likely to retain more than 80% of its initial capacity after 500 electrochemical cycles.
