# H05: Cathode_Carbon_Decoupled

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak position (cathode structural indicator) and ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator)
show weak or no spatial correlation, indicating that local cathode delithiation and carbon network
properties evolve independently across the electrode surface.

Expected Result: Weak mean correlation (|r| < 0.05) with inconsistent significance across time steps,
confirming decoupled behavior between cathode and carbon signatures.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 123.0 seconds

## Rationale
Since the sequential falsification test passed, there is no sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the A1g peak position and ID/IG ratio show weak or no spatial correlation. Therefore, we conclude that the main hypothesis is false.
