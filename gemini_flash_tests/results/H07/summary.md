# H07: A1g_Width_Decreases

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak width (A1g_Sigma) decreases with voltage, indicating peak sharpening as lithium
extraction creates a more uniform local bonding environment and reduces the distribution of
M-O bond lengths.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.63), with ~33% width decrease during charging.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 165.2 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification test "PASS" indicates that the tests failed to reject the null hypotheses. Therefore, based strictly on the provided experimental results, the main hypothesis is considered False.
