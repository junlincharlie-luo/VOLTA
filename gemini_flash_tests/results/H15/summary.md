# H15: Cation_Mixing_Cycle_Number

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

Ni2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,
detectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.

Note: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset. Only single cycle data
is available. Cannot track evolution over multiple cycles. Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for
this cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 105.7 seconds

## Rationale
Since the combined e-value of 0.8368 is high, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that the main hypothesis is false.
