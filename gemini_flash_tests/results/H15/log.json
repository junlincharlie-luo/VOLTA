The rationale is that if cycling-induced cation mixing is dominant, neighboring pixels should experience similar changes.

We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, for each time step (voltage), we'll compute the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. Finally, we'll examine the trend of spatial variance with respect to voltage.

If the *degree* of cation mixing (reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio) is primarily driven by the cycling process, we expect to see spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio *at the end of the cycle (maximum voltage)*. Spatial autocorrelation means that pixels close to each other will have more similar Eg/A1g ratios than pixels far apart. The rationale is that if cycling-induced cation mixing is dominant, neighboring pixels should experience similar changes. If, however, the spatial distribution of Eg/A1g at high voltage is random (no spatial autocorrelation), it suggests that other factors (e.g., local variations in material properties independent of cycling) are more important. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the highest voltage. Then, we will compute a measure of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran's I or Geary's C) on the Eg/A1g ratios.  A non-significant spatial autocorrelation would argue against the hypothesis that cation mixing *due to cycling* is the primary driver of spatial patterns in the Eg/A1g ratio at the cycle's end. The falsification outcome is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio across the spatial pixels at the maximum voltage. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio across the spatial pixels at the maximum voltage.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Voltage Dependence of Spatial Variance in Eg/A1g Ratio \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, and therefore the spatial variation in the Eg/A1g ratio, *increases* with cycling. Since we only have a single cycle, we can test if the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio *increases* with voltage during the single charge cycle. If the spatial variance *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing (or whatever causes the Eg/A1g changes) is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process, thus weakening the main hypothesis. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, for each time step (voltage), we'll compute the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. Finally, we'll examine the trend of spatial variance with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *negative* correlation between voltage and spatial variance of Eg/A1g. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle.\", 'Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If cycling is the dominant driver, the *spatial distribution* of the Eg/A1g ratio should *change* significantly from the beginning to the end of the cycle. If, however, the spatial distribution remains relatively consistent, it suggests that pre-existing material properties or other cycle-independent factors dictate the spatial pattern of Eg/A1g, rather than the cycling process itself. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the *initial state* (lowest voltage) and at the *final state* (highest voltage). Then, we will compute a measure of similarity between the two spatial distributions of Eg/A1g ratios. A high degree of similarity would argue against the hypothesis that cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. We can quantify similarity using spatial correlation or other metrics that assess the resemblance of two spatial patterns. The falsification outcome will be a p-value associated with the similarity metric. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are independent (i.e., not significantly similar). \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are significantly similar.', \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If this is true, as the voltage increases during the charge cycle, the range (maximum - minimum) of Eg/A1g ratios observed across the spatial pixels should also increase. A wider range implies more diverse local environments in terms of cation mixing, presumably driven by the charging process. If the voltage increases, but the range of Eg/A1g values across the spatial pixels does not increase (or even decreases), it suggests that the charging process is not the primary factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of cation mixing. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). For each time step (voltage), we'll compute the range of Eg/A1g ratios across all spatial pixels. Then, we'll calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. A weak or negative correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of the spatial diversity of Eg/A1g ratio changes.

If this is true, then changes in the Eg/A1g ratio should be temporally correlated with changes in voltage *during* the charge cycle.  If changes in voltage do *not* predict changes in the Eg/A1g ratio, this would suggest that other time-dependent factors (unrelated to the battery's charging state) are driving the observed Eg/A1g changes. We will calculate the change in Eg/A1g ratio and the change in Voltage between consecutive time steps for each spatial pixel. Then, we'll compute the temporal correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between these changes across all time steps and spatial pixels. A weak or non-significant correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The falsification outcome is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no temporal correlation between the change in Eg/A1g ratio and the change in Voltage across all time steps and spatial pixels. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant temporal correlation between the change in Eg/A1g ratio and the change in Voltage across all time steps and spatial pixels.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If the *degree* of cation mixing (reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio) is primarily driven by the cycling process, we expect to see spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio *at the end of the cycle (maximum voltage)*. Spatial autocorrelation means that pixels close to each other will have more similar Eg/A1g ratios than pixels far apart. The rationale is that if cycling-induced cation mixing is dominant, neighboring pixels should experience similar changes. If, however, the spatial distribution of Eg/A1g at high voltage is random (no spatial autocorrelation), it suggests that other factors (e.g., local variations in material properties independent of cycling) are more important. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the highest voltage. Then, we will compute a measure of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran's I or Geary's C) on the Eg/A1g ratios.  A non-significant spatial autocorrelation would argue against the hypothesis that cation mixing *due to cycling* is the primary driver of spatial patterns in the Eg/A1g ratio at the cycle's end. The falsification outcome is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio across the spatial pixels at the maximum voltage. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio across the spatial pixels at the maximum voltage.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

Since we only have a single cycle, we can test if the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio *increases* with voltage during the single charge cycle. If the spatial variance *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing (or whatever causes the Eg/A1g changes) is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process, thus weakening the main hypothesis. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, for each time step (voltage), we'll compute the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. Finally, we'll examine the trend of spatial variance with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *negative* correlation between voltage and spatial variance of Eg/A1g. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle.\", 'Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If cycling is the dominant driver, the *spatial distribution* of the Eg/A1g ratio should *change* significantly from the beginning to the end of the cycle. If, however, the spatial distribution remains relatively consistent, it suggests that pre-existing material properties or other cycle-independent factors dictate the spatial pattern of Eg/A1g, rather than the cycling process itself. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the *initial state* (lowest voltage) and at the *final state* (highest voltage). Then, we will compute a measure of similarity between the two spatial distributions of Eg/A1g ratios. A high degree of similarity would argue against the hypothesis that cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. We can quantify similarity using spatial correlation or other metrics that assess the resemblance of two spatial patterns. The falsification outcome will be a p-value associated with the similarity metric. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are independent (i.e., not significantly similar). \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are significantly similar.', \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If this is true, as the voltage increases during the charge cycle, the range (maximum - minimum) of Eg/A1g ratios observed across the spatial pixels should also increase. A wider range implies more diverse local environments in terms of cation mixing, presumably driven by the charging process. If the voltage increases, but the range of Eg/A1g values across the spatial pixels does not increase (or even decreases), it suggests that the charging process is not the primary factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of cation mixing. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). For each time step (voltage), we'll compute the range of Eg/A1g ratios across all spatial pixels. Then, we'll calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. A weak or negative correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of the spatial diversity of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the correlation between voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

While we only have single-cycle data, we can test if there's a *voltage threshold* at which significant changes in the Eg/A1g ratio begin to occur. If cation mixing is directly driven by the electrochemical process, we'd expect to see a point during the charge cycle where the Eg/A1g ratio starts to change more rapidly. If the Eg/A1g ratio changes are gradual and uniformly distributed across the entire voltage range, it suggests that the changes are not strongly tied to a specific electrochemical event related to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, we will identify the voltage at which the *rate of change* of the average Eg/A1g ratio (averaged across all spatial pixels) exceeds a certain threshold. If such a threshold does *not* exist (i.e., the rate of change is consistently low), it would argue against the hypothesis. We will then perform a permutation test to check if the observed rate of change after the threshold voltage is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There exists a voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If this is true, then as the voltage increases, we expect to see an increase in the *spatial gradient* of the Eg/A1g ratio. A higher spatial gradient implies a more heterogeneous distribution of cation mixing across the material. This is because different regions will experience different extents of cation mixing during charging. If the spatial gradient of Eg/A1g *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at several voltage levels (e.g., at 3.05V, 3.5V, 4.0V, and 4.5V). Then, for each voltage level, we'll compute the spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio. Finally, we'll examine the trend of the average spatial gradient with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *positive* correlation between voltage and the average spatial gradient of Eg/A1g. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle.\"]\n\"\"\"\n\nA good falsification test should serve as a strong evidence for the main hypothesis.

The rationale is that the plateau represents a specific electrochemical process occurring relatively uniformly across the material.

Then, we'll compute the spatial correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the Eg/A1g ratio and Voltage across all spatial pixels at that initial state.

If this is true, then changes in the Eg/A1g ratio should be temporally correlated with changes in voltage *during* the charge cycle.  If changes in voltage do *not* predict changes in the Eg/A1g ratio, this would suggest that other time-dependent factors (unrelated to the battery's charging state) are driving the observed Eg/A1g changes. We will calculate the change in Eg/A1g ratio and the change in Voltage between consecutive time steps for each spatial pixel.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Spatial Autocorrelation of Eg/A1g Ratio at Maximum Voltage \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links cation mixing and Eg/A1g ratio changes to the cycling process. If the *degree* of cation mixing (reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio) is primarily driven by the cycling process, we expect to see spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio *at the end of the cycle (maximum voltage)*. Spatial autocorrelation means that pixels close to each other will have more similar Eg/A1g ratios than pixels far apart. The rationale is that if cycling-induced cation mixing is dominant, neighboring pixels should experience similar changes. If, however, the spatial distribution of Eg/A1g at high voltage is random (no spatial autocorrelation), it suggests that other factors (e.g., local variations in material properties independent of cycling) are more important. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the highest voltage. Then, we will compute a measure of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran's I or Geary's C) on the Eg/A1g ratios.  A non-significant spatial autocorrelation would argue against the hypothesis that cation mixing *due to cycling* is the primary driver of spatial patterns in the Eg/A1g ratio at the cycle's end.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Voltage Dependence of Spatial Variance in Eg/A1g Ratio \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, and therefore the spatial variation in the Eg/A1g ratio, *increases* with cycling. Since we only have a single cycle, we can test if the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio *increases* with voltage during the single charge cycle. If the spatial variance *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing (or whatever causes the Eg/A1g changes) is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process, thus weakening the main hypothesis. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, for each time step (voltage), we'll compute the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. Finally, we'll examine the trend of spatial variance with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *negative* correlation between voltage and spatial variance of Eg/A1g. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle.\", 'Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

If cycling is the dominant driver, the *spatial distribution* of the Eg/A1g ratio should *change* significantly from the beginning to the end of the cycle. If, however, the spatial distribution remains relatively consistent, it suggests that pre-existing material properties or other cycle-independent factors dictate the spatial pattern of Eg/A1g, rather than the cycling process itself. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the *initial state* (lowest voltage) and at the *final state* (highest voltage). Then, we will compute a measure of similarity between the two spatial distributions of Eg/A1g ratios. A high degree of similarity would argue against the hypothesis that cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. We can quantify similarity using spatial correlation or other metrics that assess the resemblance of two spatial patterns. The falsification outcome will be a p-value associated with the similarity metric. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are independent (i.e., not significantly similar). \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are significantly similar.', \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Correlation between Voltage and the Range of Eg/A1g Ratios Across Spatial Pixels \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, reflected in Eg/A1g changes, increases with cycling. If this is true, as the voltage increases during the charge cycle, the range (maximum - minimum) of Eg/A1g ratios observed across the spatial pixels should also increase. A wider range implies more diverse local environments in terms of cation mixing, presumably driven by the charging process. If the voltage increases, but the range of Eg/A1g values across the spatial pixels does not increase (or even decreases), it suggests that the charging process is not the primary factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of cation mixing. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). For each time step (voltage), we'll compute the range of Eg/A1g ratios across all spatial pixels. Then, we'll calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. A weak or negative correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of the spatial diversity of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the correlation between voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Voltage Threshold for Significant Eg/A1g Ratio Change \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio, is linked to the cycling process and progresses with cycle number. While we only have single-cycle data, we can test if there's a *voltage threshold* at which significant changes in the Eg/A1g ratio begin to occur. If cation mixing is directly driven by the electrochemical process, we'd expect to see a point during the charge cycle where the Eg/A1g ratio starts to change more rapidly. If the Eg/A1g ratio changes are gradual and uniformly distributed across the entire voltage range, it suggests that the changes are not strongly tied to a specific electrochemical event related to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, we will identify the voltage at which the *rate of change* of the average Eg/A1g ratio (averaged across all spatial pixels) exceeds a certain threshold. If such a threshold does *not* exist (i.e., the rate of change is consistently low), it would argue against the hypothesis. We will then perform a permutation test to check if the observed rate of change after the threshold voltage is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There exists a voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold.\", \"Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\\n \\n Falsification Test name: Spatial Gradient of Eg/A1g Ratio at Different Voltage Levels \\n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links cation mixing (and thus Eg/A1g ratio changes) to the cycling process. If this is true, then as the voltage increases, we expect to see an increase in the *spatial gradient* of the Eg/A1g ratio. A higher spatial gradient implies a more heterogeneous distribution of cation mixing across the material. This is because different regions will experience different extents of cation mixing during charging. If the spatial gradient of Eg/A1g *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at several voltage levels (e.g., at 3.05V, 3.5V, 4.0V, and 4.5V). Then, for each voltage level, we'll compute the spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio. Finally, we'll examine the trend of the average spatial gradient with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *positive* correlation between voltage and the average spatial gradient of Eg/A1g. \\n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \\n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle.\", 'Main hypothesis: \\nNi2+/Li+ cation mixing in the layered structure increases progressively with cycle number,\\ndetectable through Eg/A1g intensity ratio changes.\\n\\nNote: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset.

By examining the spatial correlation between the Eg/A1g ratio and voltage at the initial state (beginning of the cycle), the test can reveal whether pre-existing material inhomogeneities, rather than cycling-induced cation mixing, are the primary driver of spatial variations in the Eg/A1g ratio. A significant spatial correlation at the initial state would strongly suggest that factors other than cycling are responsible for the observed Eg/A1g ratio variations, thus weakening the main hypothesis. The predictive value is high, as the presence or absence of spatial correlation directly impacts the validity of the main hypothesis's claim that cation mixing due to cycling is the primary cause of Eg/A1g ratio changes.",

If this is true, then changes in the Eg/A1g ratio should be temporally correlated with changes in voltage *during* the charge cycle.  If changes in voltage do *not* predict changes in the Eg/A1g ratio, this would suggest that other time-dependent factors (unrelated to the battery's charging state) are driving the observed Eg/A1g changes. We will calculate the change in Eg/A1g ratio and the change in Voltage between consecutive time steps for each spatial pixel. Then, we'll compute the temporal correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between these changes across all time steps and spatial pixels.

A strong temporal correlation would support the main hypothesis by linking the cycling process to the Eg/A1g ratio. A weak correlation would suggest other factors are at play.

If the *degree* of cation mixing (reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio) is primarily driven by the cycling process, we expect to see spatial autocorrelation in the Eg/A1g ratio *at the end of the cycle (maximum voltage)*. Spatial autocorrelation means that pixels close to each other will have more similar Eg/A1g ratios than pixels far apart. The rationale is that if cycling-induced cation mixing is dominant, neighboring pixels should experience similar changes. If, however, the spatial distribution of Eg/A1g at high voltage is random (no spatial autocorrelation), it suggests that other factors (e.g., local variations in material properties independent of cycling) are more important. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the highest voltage. Then, we will compute a measure of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran's I or Geary's C) on the Eg/A1g ratios.  A non-significant spatial autocorrelation would argue against the hypothesis that cation mixing *due to cycling* is the primary driver of spatial patterns in the Eg/A1g ratio at the cycle's end.

While the main hypothesis posits that cation mixing (reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio) increases with cycle number, this test focuses on a single cycle and checks if the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio is random or correlated. If there's spatial autocorrelation, it suggests that cycling-induced cation mixing is a dominant factor. If not, other factors might be more important. This provides some evidence related to the cation mixing at the end of a cycle, but it doesn't directly address how the ratio changes *progressively with cycle number* due to the limitation of single cycle data. Therefore, it provides moderate relevance.",

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Voltage Dependence of Spatial Variance in Eg/A1g Ratio \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, and therefore the spatial variation in the Eg/A1g ratio, *increases* with cycling. Since we only have a single cycle, we can test if the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio *increases* with voltage during the single charge cycle. If the spatial variance *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing (or whatever causes the Eg/A1g changes) is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process, thus weakening the main hypothesis. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, for each time step (voltage), we'll compute the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. Finally, we'll examine the trend of spatial variance with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *negative* correlation between voltage and spatial variance of Eg/A1g. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant negative correlation between the voltage and the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \nRelevance score: 0.4 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis aims to test if the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio increases with voltage during a single charge cycle. While the main hypothesis focuses on the increase of cation mixing (reflected in Eg/A1g ratio) over *multiple* cycles, this test attempts to find a related trend *within* a single cycle. If the variance decreases or remains constant with voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing (or whatever causes the Eg/A1g changes) is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process, thus weakening the main hypothesis. This provides some, albeit limited, evidence related to the behavior of the Eg/A1g ratio.

If cycling is the dominant driver, the *spatial distribution* of the Eg/A1g ratio should *change* significantly from the beginning to the end of the cycle. If, however, the spatial distribution remains relatively consistent, it suggests that pre-existing material properties or other cycle-independent factors dictate the spatial pattern of Eg/A1g, rather than the cycling process itself. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the *initial state* (lowest voltage) and at the *final state* (highest voltage). Then, we will compute a measure of similarity between the two spatial distributions of Eg/A1g ratios. A high degree of similarity would argue against the hypothesis that cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. We can quantify similarity using spatial correlation or other metrics that assess the resemblance of two spatial patterns. The falsification outcome will be a p-value associated with the similarity metric. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are independent (i.e., not significantly similar). \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the initial state and the spatial distribution of the Eg/A1g ratio at the final state are significantly similar. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test assesses the spatial distribution consistency of the Eg/A1g ratio between the initial and final states of a single cycle. While the main hypothesis focuses on the *progressive* change over *multiple* cycles, this test examines the change within a single cycle. A high similarity in spatial distribution from initial to final state would suggest that the cycling process within a single cycle does not significantly alter the spatial pattern of cation mixing, which would weaken the argument that cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. However, because the main hypothesis emphasizes changes *over multiple cycles*, the relevance is limited. The test provides some insight into whether a single cycle induces changes consistent with the main hypothesis, but it cannot directly address the cycle-dependent trend.",

If this is true, as the voltage increases during the charge cycle, the range (maximum - minimum) of Eg/A1g ratios observed across the spatial pixels should also increase. A wider range implies more diverse local environments in terms of cation mixing, presumably driven by the charging process. If the voltage increases, but the range of Eg/A1g values across the spatial pixels does not increase (or even decreases), it suggests that the charging process is not the primary factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of cation mixing. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). For each time step (voltage), we'll compute the range of Eg/A1g ratios across all spatial pixels. Then, we'll calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. A weak or negative correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of the spatial diversity of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the correlation between voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across the charge cycle. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test examines the relationship between voltage and the range of Eg/A1g ratios across spatial pixels during a single charge cycle. While the main hypothesis focuses on the progressive increase of cation mixing (detectable through Eg/A1g changes) with cycle number, this test only looks at a single cycle. Although a correlation within a single cycle could indicate some cation mixing dynamics, it doesn't directly address the cycle-dependent aspect of the main hypothesis. The test has some predictive value in that a strong correlation would weakly support the idea that charging influences cation mixing, but it doesn't confirm the progressive increase over multiple cycles. Therefore, the test is moderately relevant.",

Only single cycle data\nis available. Cannot track evolution over multiple cycles. Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Voltage Threshold for Significant Eg/A1g Ratio Change \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that cation mixing, reflected in the Eg/A1g ratio, is linked to the cycling process and progresses with cycle number. While we only have single-cycle data, we can test if there's a *voltage threshold* at which significant changes in the Eg/A1g ratio begin to occur. If cation mixing is directly driven by the electrochemical process, we'd expect to see a point during the charge cycle where the Eg/A1g ratio starts to change more rapidly. If the Eg/A1g ratio changes are gradual and uniformly distributed across the entire voltage range, it suggests that the changes are not strongly tied to a specific electrochemical event related to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at each time step (voltage). Then, we will identify the voltage at which the *rate of change* of the average Eg/A1g ratio (averaged across all spatial pixels) exceeds a certain threshold. If such a threshold does *not* exist (i.e., the rate of change is consistently low), it would argue against the hypothesis. We will then perform a permutation test to check if the observed rate of change after the threshold voltage is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There exists a voltage threshold during the charge cycle after which the rate of change of the average Eg/A1g ratio is significantly higher than the rate of change before the threshold. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test attempts to find a voltage threshold for Eg/A1g ratio changes within a single cycle. While the main hypothesis posits that these changes occur *progressively with cycle number* (which cannot be directly verified with single-cycle data), the test explores if changes in Eg/A1g are at least correlated with the electrochemical process (voltage) within a single cycle. Discovering a voltage threshold where the Eg/A1g ratio changes rapidly would suggest a link between the electrochemical process and cation mixing, providing some support (albeit indirect) to the main hypothesis that cation mixing is related to the cycling process. However, failing to find such a threshold would not necessarily refute the main hypothesis since the main hypothesis focuses on cycle-dependent trends. Therefore, this test has moderate relevance.",

Only single cycle data\nis available. Cannot track evolution over multiple cycles. Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Spatial Gradient of Eg/A1g Ratio at Different Voltage Levels \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links cation mixing (and thus Eg/A1g ratio changes) to the cycling process. If this is true, then as the voltage increases, we expect to see an increase in the *spatial gradient* of the Eg/A1g ratio. A higher spatial gradient implies a more heterogeneous distribution of cation mixing across the material. This is because different regions will experience different extents of cation mixing during charging. If the spatial gradient of Eg/A1g *decreases* or remains constant with increasing voltage, it would suggest that the cation mixing is not directly and monotonically linked to the charging process. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at several voltage levels (e.g., at 3.05V, 3.5V, 4.0V, and 4.5V). Then, for each voltage level, we'll compute the spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio. Finally, we'll examine the trend of the average spatial gradient with respect to voltage. A decreasing or flat trend would provide evidence against the main hypothesis. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of the *positive* correlation between voltage and the average spatial gradient of Eg/A1g. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the voltage and the average spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio across the charge cycle. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis examines the spatial gradient of the Eg/A1g ratio at different voltage levels, which is relevant to the main hypothesis that links cation mixing (reflected by Eg/A1g ratio) to the cycling process. Although the main hypothesis focuses on changes with cycle number and the available data is only for a single cycle, examining the spatial gradient at different voltage levels within that single cycle can still provide some insight into whether cation mixing is related to the charging process, a component of cycling. If the spatial gradient increases with voltage, it would suggest that the charging process induces heterogeneous cation mixing, supporting the idea that cycling-related processes influence cation mixing. However, the lack of multi-cycle data limits the strength of the evidence. Therefore, a score of 0.6 is appropriate.",

Only single cycle data\nis available. Cannot track evolution over multiple cycles. Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Homogeneity of Eg/A1g Ratio Change at Plateau Voltage \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links cation mixing and Eg/A1g ratio changes to the cycling process. Many battery charge profiles exhibit a plateau region at a specific voltage, often associated with a particular phase transition or electrochemical reaction. If the cycling-induced cation mixing is the dominant factor influencing the Eg/A1g ratio, we would expect the change in the Eg/A1g ratio during this plateau to be relatively homogeneous across the spatial pixels. The rationale is that the plateau represents a specific electrochemical process occurring relatively uniformly across the material. If the change in Eg/A1g during the plateau is spatially heterogeneous, it suggests that other localized factors (e.g., pre-existing defects, local variations in conductivity) are influencing the Eg/A1g ratio changes more than the overall cycling process. We will identify the voltage plateau region in the single charge cycle. Then, for each spatial pixel, calculate the change in the Eg/A1g ratio during this plateau (final value - initial value within the plateau). Finally, we will compute a measure of the spatial variance of the Eg/A1g ratio change across all spatial pixels during the plateau. A high spatial variance would argue against the hypothesis that cation mixing due to the cycling process is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes during the plateau. We will conduct a statistical test (e.g., comparing the observed variance to a null distribution generated by random permutations of the Eg/A1g ratio changes) to determine if the variance is significantly high. The falsification outcome is a p-value associated with the variance. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: The spatial variance of the change in the Eg/A1g ratio during the voltage plateau is not significantly different from the variance expected by random chance. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The spatial variance of the change in the Eg/A1g ratio during the voltage plateau is significantly higher than the variance expected by random chance. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test examines the spatial homogeneity of Eg/A1g ratio changes during a voltage plateau, which is linked to the cycling process. A high spatial variance in the Eg/A1g ratio change would suggest that factors other than cycling-induced cation mixing are influencing the Eg/A1g ratio. This provides indirect evidence against the main hypothesis that cation mixing due to cycling is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The mechanistic connection is that if cation mixing is uniform, the Eg/A1g ratio change should also be relatively uniform during the plateau. The predictive value is moderate, as a high variance would weaken the support for the main hypothesis, while a low variance would offer some support, though not definitive proof due to the single-cycle limitation.",

Only single cycle data\nis available. Cannot track evolution over multiple cycles. Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Correlation between Initial Eg/A1g Ratio and Total Eg/A1g Ratio Change during Charge \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis posits that cycling leads to cation mixing, detectable via Eg/A1g ratio changes. If the *initial* state of the material (before cycling) has a significant influence on the *total* change in the Eg/A1g ratio during the single cycle, it suggests that pre-existing conditions (e.g., inherent material heterogeneity) play a dominant role in determining the extent of cation mixing, rather than the cycling process itself. We will calculate the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel at the initial state (lowest voltage). We will also calculate the *total change* in the Eg/A1g ratio for each spatial pixel during the entire charge cycle (final value - initial value). Then, we will compute the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the initial Eg/A1g ratio and the total Eg/A1g ratio change across all spatial pixels.

This provides some evidence against the main hypothesis, although it doesn't directly refute the cycle-dependent aspect. Therefore, the relevance is moderate.",

Eg/A1g ratio could be computed for\nthis cycle, but cycle-dependent trend requires multi-cycle data.\n \n Falsification Test name: Spatial Correlation Between Voltage Drop and Eg/A1g Ratio Change \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links cation mixing (and thus Eg/A1g ratio changes) to the cycling process. During the charge cycle, there might be local variations in the electrochemical activity, leading to variations in the local voltage. If the cation mixing is driven by the electrochemical process, we would expect that regions experiencing a larger voltage drop during the charge cycle would also exhibit a larger change in the Eg/A1g ratio. This is because a larger voltage drop might indicate a more active region where more cation mixing occurs. We will calculate the total voltage drop for each spatial pixel (maximum voltage - minimum voltage). We will also calculate the total change in the Eg/A1g ratio for each pixel during the entire charge cycle (final Eg/A1g ratio - initial Eg/A1g ratio). Finally, we will compute the spatial correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the total voltage drop and the total change in the Eg/A1g ratio across all spatial pixels. A weak or non-significant correlation would argue against the hypothesis that the cycling process is the primary driver of Eg/A1g ratio changes. The falsification outcome is a p-value measuring the significance of this correlation. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no spatial correlation between the total voltage drop and the total Eg/A1g ratio change across the spatial pixels during the charge cycle. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a statistically significant spatial correlation between the total voltage drop and the total Eg/A1g ratio change across the spatial pixels during the charge cycle. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test directly links spatial variations in voltage drop (related to electrochemical activity during cycling) to changes in the Eg/A1g ratio (a proxy for cation mixing). If regions with larger voltage drops also show larger changes in the Eg/A1g ratio, it would support the main hypothesis that the cycling process drives cation mixing. A lack of correlation would weaken this hypothesis. The test has moderate predictive value because it examines a direct consequence of the main hypothesis, although it doesn't directly prove the cycle-dependent increase in cation mixing."
