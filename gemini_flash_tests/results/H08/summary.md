# H08: G_Band_Redshift

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The G-band center position shifts to lower wavenumbers (redshifts) with increasing voltage,
reflecting charge transfer interactions between the carbon conductive network and the delithiating
cathode particles, or electrochemical doping effects on the carbon.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.74), with G-band shifting ~3.5 cm^-1 per volt.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 115.1 seconds

## Rationale
Although the tests did pass, the hypothesis is ultimately deemed false. This is based on the instructions that if the experiments fail to reject the null hypothesis, the conclusion MUST be output as False.
