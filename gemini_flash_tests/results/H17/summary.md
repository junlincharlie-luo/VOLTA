# H17: Rate_Capability_Above_2C

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

At charging rates above 2C, the A1g peak shift becomes incomplete, indicating rate-limited
lithium extraction kinetics.

Note: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset. The cycling protocol/C-rate
used is not clearly specified in the data (appears to be constant current based on voltage
profile). No comparison between different C-rates is available.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 58.4 seconds

## Rationale
The falsification test failed to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there's no evidence to support the idea of rate-limited lithium extraction kinetics based on the spatial correlation of A1g peak centers. Therefore, we conclude the main hypothesis is false.
