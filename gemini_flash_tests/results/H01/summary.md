# H01: A1g_Voltage_Correlation

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The A1g peak center position (cm^-1) decreases (redshifts) with increasing voltage during charging,
reflecting delithiation-induced M-O bond weakening in Li-rich layered oxides due to oxygen redox
participation and structural distortion.

Expected Result: Strong negative correlation (r ~ -0.88), with A1g peak shifting ~22 cm^-1 lower
during charging from 3.05V to 4.68V.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 92.9 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential falsification test passed, providing evidence against rejecting the main hypothesis. According to the instruction, if the experiments fail to reject the null hypothesis, the conclusion should be "False".
