# H09: D_Band_Time_Delayed

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

Changes in D-band amplitude (D_Amp) lag behind voltage changes by at least one measurement interval
(15 min), suggesting SEI formation or carbon network modification is a kinetically slow process
compared to cathode delithiation.

Expected Result: Cross-correlation analysis shows D_Amp changes lag voltage changes by >= 15 min.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 129.0 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential testing resulted in sufficient evidence to PASS the main hypothesis. However, since the falsification test aims to reject the null hypothesis and not to prove it, the conclusion should be that the main hypothesis is false.
