# H04: Eg_Amplitude_Increases

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The Eg peak amplitude (related to M-O bending in layered structure) increases during charging,
reflecting enhanced Raman scattering from M-O bending modes as lithium extraction modifies the
electronic structure and increases optical transparency of the cathode material.

Expected Result: Positive correlation (r ~ +0.28) with ~30% amplitude increase during charging.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 135.8 seconds

## Rationale
Even though the tests passed and support the main hypothesis, the sequential testing procedure is designed to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the conclusion of the falsification test is that the main hypothesis is considered False.
