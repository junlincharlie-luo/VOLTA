# H06: Edge_Center_Uniformity

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

Pixels at the edges of the 30x30 mapping region exhibit statistically similar A1g peak evolution
compared to center pixels, indicating homogeneous electrochemical accessibility across the mapped
electrode area at the 30 um scale.

Expected Result: No significant difference in A1g shift between edge and center pixels (p > 0.05).


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 118.0 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential testing result is a PASS with a combined e-value of 2.3053472298853673e+44. Since the sequential testing passed the falsification tests, we fail to reject the null hypothesis; therefore, the main hypothesis is determined to be false.
