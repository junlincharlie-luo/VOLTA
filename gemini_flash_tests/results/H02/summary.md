# H02: Spatial_Heterogeneity_Increases

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The standard deviation of A1g_Center across the 900 spatial pixels increases as voltage increases,
indicating growing electrochemical heterogeneity during delithiation in Li-rich layered oxides.

Expected Result: Positive correlation between voltage and spatial standard deviation of A1g_Center,
with heterogeneity increasing during the charging process from 3.05V to 4.68V.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 31.5 seconds

## Rationale
The falsification test aims to disprove the main hypothesis. Since the test passed (i.e., there was sufficient evidence to reject the null sub-hypothesis), it suggests that the spatial autocorrelation of A1g_Center increases with voltage. This provides evidence *against* falsifying the main hypothesis, which is interpreted as the main hypothesis being false.
