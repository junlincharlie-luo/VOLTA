      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nOkay, let's start by proposing an initial falsification test.\n\n**Initial Falsification Test Proposal:**\n\n(1) Name: **A1g Peak Position Shift at High Voltage**\n\n(2) Test description: The main hypothesis links high voltage (>4.3V) to enhanced graphitic ordering due to electrochemical activation. While ID/IG ratio reflects disorder, the A1g peak position in Raman spectra is sensitive to changes in bond length and strain within the graphitic lattice. If the electrochemical activation at high voltage indeed leads to a more ordered structure, it might also induce a shift in the A1g peak position. We can test if the average A1g peak position changes significantly after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. A shift towards higher wavenumbers could indicate increased graphitic ordering or decreased bond length, supporting the main hypothesis. Conversely, no significant shift, or a shift in the opposite direction, would weaken the hypothesis.\n\n(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: There is no significant change in the average A1g peak position before and after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean A1g_Center for V > 4.3V is equal to the mean A1g_Center for V <= 4.3V.\n\n(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: The average A1g peak position is significantly different after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean A1g_Center for V > 4.3V is not equal to the mean A1g_Center for V <= 4.3V. We can perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means.\n\nNow, let's analyze this proposal.\n\n**Round 1:**\n\n(1) **Critic:**\n\n*   **Null Hypothesis Validity:** If the main hypothesis is null (i.e., voltage doesn't influence graphitic ordering), then we would also expect no significant change in the A1g peak position around 4.3V. Thus, if the main hypothesis is false, the sub-hypothesis is also likely to be false, so it satisfies the required property.\n*   **Redundancy:** This test is distinct from the previous ones. We are looking at the A1g peak, which is a different Raman parameter than the ID/IG ratio. The spatial and temporal analyses done earlier are also different from a direct comparison of A1g peak positions.\n*   **Overlap with Failed Tests:** This is non-overlapping with failed tests as well.\n*   **Data Availability and Implementability:** We have the 'A1g_Center' and 'Voltage' columns, so this is directly implementable.\n*   **Implication Strength:** A significant shift in the A1g peak position would provide stronger evidence for the structural changes proposed in the main hypothesis than simply observing a change in ID/IG ratio. It provides a more direct link to the graphitic lattice.\n\n(2) **Reflect:**\n\nThe initial proposal is good, but we can make it stronger. Instead of just looking for *any* significant difference, we should specify the *direction* of the expected shift. Enhanced graphitic ordering would likely lead to a *higher* wavenumber for the A1g peak. Also, a simple t-test comparing means across the entire dataset might miss subtle changes. It may be better to calculate the A1g peak shift *for each pixel* and then test if the *average shift* is significantly positive. This will account for pixel-to-pixel variations.\n\n**Revised Falsification Test Proposal:**\n\n(1) Name: **Pixel-wise A1g Peak Position Shift at High Voltage**\n\n(2) Test description: The main hypothesis links high voltage (>4.3V) to enhanced graphitic ordering. If electrochemical activation at high voltage leads to a more ordered structure, it should induce a shift in the A1g peak position towards higher wavenumbers. We can test if the *average pixel-wise* A1g peak position shift is significantly positive after the voltage exceeds 4.3V.\n\n(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: There is no significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is less than or equal to zero.\n\n(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: There is a significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is greater than zero. We can perform a one-sample t-test to test if the mean shift is significantly greater than zero.\n\nNow let's analyze this revised proposal.\n\n**Round 2:**\n\n(1) **Critic:**\n\n*   **Null Hypothesis Validity:** If the main hypothesis is null (i.e., voltage doesn't influence graphitic ordering), then we would also expect no significant *positive* shift in the A1g peak position around 4.3V. The null hypothesis, that the mean shift is less than or equal to zero, appropriately captures the scenario where the main hypothesis is false.\n*   **Redundancy:** This remains distinct from the previous tests as it focuses on a different Raman parameter (A1g peak position) and uses a different statistical approach (pixel-wise shift analysis).\n*   **Overlap with Failed Tests:** Still non-overlapping with the failed tests.\n*   **Data Availability and Implementability:** We have 'A1g_Center', 'Voltage', 'X', and 'Y' columns. We can group by X, Y to perform the pixel-wise calculation.\n*   **Implication Strength:** This revised test is stronger because it focuses on a *positive* shift, which is the expected direction based on the main hypothesis. Using a pixel-wise approach makes the analysis more robust to spatial variations.\n\n(2) **Reflect:**\n\nThis test is well-defined and should provide a good falsification test for the main hypothesis. I am satisfied with this definition.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n(1) Name: **Pixel-wise A1g Peak Position Shift at High Voltage**\n\n(2) Test description: The main hypothesis links high voltage (>4.3V) to enhanced graphitic ordering. If electrochemical activation at high voltage leads to a more ordered structure, it should induce a shift in the A1g peak position towards higher wavenumbers. We can test if the *average pixel-wise* A1g peak position shift is significantly positive after the voltage exceeds 4.3V.\n\n(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: There is no significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is less than or equal to zero.\n\n(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: There is a significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is greater than zero.

If this is the case, we should also observe a stabilization of the spatial variance of the ID/IG ratio over time at voltages above 4.3V. This is because the electrochemical activation should lead to a more uniform effect across the spatial pixels, reducing the spatial differences in ID/IG ratio. Specifically, we will calculate the spatial variance of ID/IG at each time step. Then, we'll compare the *change* in this spatial variance over time for voltages above and below the 4.3V threshold. A smaller change (or even a decrease) in spatial variance above 4.3V, compared to below, would support the main hypothesis.

      "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nOkay, let's start with an initial falsification test proposal.\n\n**Initial Falsification Test Proposal:**\n\n(1) **Name:** Voltage Threshold for Significant ID/IG Decrease\n\n(2) **Test description:** The main hypothesis states that the ID/IG ratio *significantly* decreases when the voltage exceeds 4.3V. This implies that 4.3V is a meaningful threshold. A falsification test would be to check if there's anything special about the ID/IG behavior *specifically* at 4.3V, compared to other voltage thresholds. If the decrease in ID/IG is simply a continuous function of voltage, rather than a threshold effect, then using 4.3V as a strict cutoff is not justified.\n\n   We can test this by comparing the *rate of change* of ID/IG with respect to voltage *around* 4.3V to the rate of change at other voltage points. If 4.3V is a true threshold, the rate of change of ID/IG should be significantly *steeper* at 4.3V than at other voltages. We can calculate the derivative (or a discrete approximation of it) of ID/IG with respect to voltage for each pixel. Then, we can compare the distribution of these derivatives at voltages close to 4.3V (e.g., 4.2V-4.4V) to the distribution of derivatives at other voltage ranges (e.g., 3.5V-3.7V, 4.5V-4.7V). A significantly more negative distribution of derivatives around 4.3V would support the threshold hypothesis.\n\n(3) **Null sub-hypothesis h_0:** There is no significant difference in the rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges. Specifically, the distribution of the derivatives of ID/IG with respect to voltage in the range [4.2V, 4.4V] is not significantly different from the distribution of derivatives in other voltage ranges (e.g., [3.5V, 3.7V] and [4.5V, 4.7V]).\n\n(4) **Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:** The rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage is significantly more negative around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges. Specifically, the distribution of the derivatives of ID/IG with respect to voltage in the range [4.2V, 4.4V] is significantly more negative than the distribution of derivatives in other voltage ranges (e.g., [3.5V, 3.7V] and [4.5V, 4.7V]). We can use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions.\n\nNow, let's go to the critic.\n"

      "```\nOkay, I understand the hypothesis and the data available. The goal is to determine if the change in the ID/IG ratio above 4.3V exhibits spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that pixels close to each other have similar changes in the ID/IG ratio. I will use Moran's I to quantify spatial autocorrelation.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Calculate the average ID/IG ratio below 4.3V:** For each pixel, calculate the mean ID/IG ratio for all time points where the voltage is less than 4.3V.\n2.  **Calculate the average ID/IG ratio above 4.3V:** For each pixel, calculate the mean ID/IG ratio for all time points where the voltage is greater than 4.3V.\n3.  **Calculate the ID/IG change:** Subtract the average ID/IG ratio below 4.3V from the average ID/IG ratio above 4.3V for each pixel. This gives the change in ID/IG ratio due to the electrochemical activation.\n4.  **Calculate Moran's I:** Use the calculated ID/IG change to compute Moran's I. A positive Moran's I indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values tend to cluster together.\n5.  **Test for Significance:** Determine the p-value for Moran's I to assess the statistical significance of the spatial autocorrelation. A small p-value would suggest that the observed spatial autocorrelation is unlikely to occur by chance, thus supporting the alternative hypothesis.\n\nI will start by calculating the average ID/IG ratio below and above 4.3V.\nAction: python_repl_ast\nAction Input: import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the voltage threshold\nvoltage_threshold = 4.3\n\n# Calculate average ID/IG ratio below the threshold\ndf_below = df[df['Voltage'] < voltage_threshold].groupby(['X', 'Y'])['ID_IG_Ratio'].mean().reset_index()\ndf_below = df_below.rename(columns={'ID_IG_Ratio': 'ID_IG_Below'})\n\n# Calculate average ID/IG ratio above the threshold\ndf_above = df[df['Voltage'] >= voltage_threshold].groupby(['X', 'Y'])['ID_IG_Ratio'].mean().reset_index()\ndf_above = df_above.rename(columns={'ID_IG_Ratio': 'ID_IG_Above'})\n\n# Merge the two dataframes\ndf_change = pd.merge(df_below, df_above, on=['X', 'Y'], how='inner')\n\n# Calculate the change in ID/IG ratio\ndf_change['ID_IG_Change'] = df_change['ID_IG_Above'] - df_change['ID_IG_Below']\n\nprint(df_change.head())\n```",

If this is true, we should expect *spatial* clustering of ID/IG decreases above this voltage. Specifically, pixels that are spatially close to each other should exhibit more similar ID/IG changes above 4.3V than pixels that are far apart. We can test this by calculating the spatial autocorrelation (e.g., using Moran's I) of the *change* in ID/IG above and below the 4.3V threshold. A significant positive spatial autocorrelation above 4.3V, compared to below, would support the main hypothesis, while a lack of significant spatial autocorrelation above 4.3V would weaken it. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant difference in spatial autocorrelation of ID/IG ratio changes between voltages above and below 4.3V.

If the electrochemical activation is a global phenomenon as suggested, then spatial autocorrelation of ID/IG changes should be observed. This provides a mechanistic link and predictive value. A significant spatial correlation would support the hypothesis, while a lack thereof would weaken it. Therefore, this test is strongly relevant.",

If this is the case, we should also observe a stabilization of the spatial variance of the ID/IG ratio over time at voltages above 4.3V. This is because the electrochemical activation should lead to a more uniform effect across the spatial pixels, reducing the spatial differences in ID/IG ratio. Specifically, we will calculate the spatial variance of ID/IG at each time step. Then, we'll compare the *change* in this spatial variance over time for voltages above and below the 4.3V threshold. A smaller change (or even a decrease) in spatial variance above 4.3V, compared to below, would support the main hypothesis. A larger change would weaken it. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the temporal change of spatial ID/IG variance between voltages above and below 4.3V. Specifically, the difference in the absolute change in spatial variance of ID/IG ratio over time ( |variance(ID/IG at time t+1) - variance(ID/IG at time t)| ) is not significantly different between V > 4.3V and V <= 4.3V. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The temporal change of spatial ID/IG variance is significantly smaller at voltages above 4.3V compared to below 4.3V. Specifically, the difference in the absolute change in spatial variance of ID/IG ratio over time ( |variance(ID/IG at time t+1) - variance(ID/IG at time t)| ) is significantly smaller for V > 4.3V than for V <= 4.3V. \nRelevance score: 0.6 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test examines whether the spatial variance of the ID/IG ratio stabilizes over time at high voltages. This is relevant because the main hypothesis suggests that high voltage leads to a more ordered graphitic structure, which should manifest as a reduction in ID/IG ratio and, consequently, a stabilization of its spatial variance. The test directly assesses a consequence of the main hypothesis, providing supporting evidence if the spatial variance decreases at high voltages or refuting evidence if it increases or remains unchanged. The predictive value is moderate, as stabilization of spatial variance is one possible outcome of enhanced graphitic ordering.",

If the carbon structure becomes more ordered at higher voltages, we might expect the A1g peak to become narrower, indicating a more uniform carbon environment. We can test this by examining the correlation between the voltage and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the A1g peak. A negative correlation would support the hypothesis, suggesting that as voltage increases, the A1g peak becomes narrower, indicating improved graphitic ordering. Since FWHM is not directly available, we can approximate it by looking at the absolute deviation of A1g_Center from its mean value at each voltage. The lower this deviation, the sharper the peak. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between voltage and the absolute deviation of the A1g peak position from its mean.

If this is true, we should observe a consistent *temporal* trend of decreasing ID/IG at each spatial pixel *after* the voltage exceeds 4.3V. This means that the ID/IG ratio at a given pixel should be negatively correlated with time *after* the voltage threshold is reached. We can test this by calculating the temporal correlation (e.g., Pearson's r) between ID/IG and Time_Min for each pixel, but only considering the data points where Voltage > 4.3V.

This implies that 4.3V is a meaningful threshold. A falsification test would be to check if there's anything special about the ID/IG behavior specifically at 4.3V, compared to other voltage thresholds. If the decrease in ID/IG is simply a continuous function of voltage, rather than a threshold effect, then using 4.3V as a strict cutoff is not justified. We can test this by comparing the rate of change of ID/IG with respect to voltage around 4.3V to the rate of change at other voltage points. If 4.3V is a true threshold, the rate of change of ID/IG should be significantly steeper at 4.3V than at other voltages. We can calculate the derivative (or a discrete approximation of it) of ID/IG with respect to voltage for each pixel. Then, we can compare the distribution of these derivatives at voltages close to 4.3V (e.g., 4.2V-4.4V) to the distribution of derivatives at other voltage ranges (e.g., 3.5V-3.7V, 4.5V-4.7V). A significantly more negative distribution of derivatives around 4.3V would support the threshold hypothesis. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges. Specifically, the distribution of the derivatives of ID/IG with respect to voltage in the range [4.2V, 4.4V] is not significantly different from the distribution of derivatives in other voltage ranges (e.g., [3.5V, 3.7V] and [4.5V, 4.7V]). \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage is significantly more negative around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges. Specifically, the distribution of the derivatives of ID/IG with respect to voltage in the range [4.2V, 4.4V] is significantly more negative than the distribution of derivatives in other voltage ranges (e.g., [3.5V, 3.7V] and [4.5V, 4.7V]). We can use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions. \nRelevance score 0.8 \nReasoning: The sub-hypothesis test directly addresses whether 4.3V is a meaningful threshold for the ID/IG ratio decrease, which is central to the main hypothesis. By comparing the rate of change of ID/IG around 4.3V to other voltage ranges, it assesses the validity of using 4.3V as a strict cutoff. This directly tests the claim that the ID/IG ratio decreases significantly *when the voltage exceeds 4.3V*, providing strong evidence for or against the main hypothesis. Therefore, it has a high predictive value."

      "================================ Human Message =================================\n\n------- Round 1 ------- \n Falsification Test: Main hypothesis: \nThe ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,\nindicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical\nactivation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.\n\nExpected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation\n(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.\n \n Falsification Test name: Spatial Correlation of ID/IG Change Above Threshold \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests a global decrease in ID/IG above 4.3V due to electrochemical activation. If this is true, we should expect *spatial* clustering of ID/IG decreases above this voltage. Specifically, pixels that are spatially close to each other should exhibit more similar ID/IG changes above 4.3V than pixels that are far apart. We can test this by calculating the spatial autocorrelation (e.g., using Moran's I) of the *change* in ID/IG above and below the 4.3V threshold. A significant positive spatial autocorrelation above 4.3V, compared to below, would support the main hypothesis, while a lack of significant spatial autocorrelation above 4.3V would weaken it. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant difference in spatial autocorrelation of ID/IG ratio changes between voltages above and below 4.3V. Specifically, Moran's I for ID/IG change (ID/IG at V>4.3V - ID/IG at V<4.3V) is not significantly different from zero. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a significantly positive spatial autocorrelation of ID/IG ratio changes at voltages above 4.3V compared to below 4.3V. Specifically, Moran's I for ID/IG change (ID/IG at V>4.3V - ID/IG at V<4.3V) is significantly greater than zero. \n test statistics: 1.0\n------- Round 2 ------- \n Falsification Test: Main hypothesis: \nThe ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,\nindicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical\nactivation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.\n\nExpected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation\n(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.\n \n Falsification Test name: Pixel-wise A1g Peak Position Shift at High Voltage \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis links high voltage (>4.3V) to enhanced graphitic ordering. If electrochemical activation at high voltage leads to a more ordered structure, it should induce a shift in the A1g peak position towards higher wavenumbers. We can test if the *average pixel-wise* A1g peak position shift is significantly positive after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is less than or equal to zero. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a significant positive shift in the average pixel-wise A1g peak position after the voltage exceeds 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the pixel-wise A1g_Center shift (A1g_Center at V>4.3V - A1g_Center at V<=4.3V) is greater than zero. We can perform a one-sample t-test to test if the mean shift is significantly greater than zero. \n test statistics: 1.0\n------- Round 3 ------- \n Falsification Test: Main hypothesis: \nThe ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,\nindicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical\nactivation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.\n\nExpected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation\n(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.\n \n Falsification Test name: Correlation between Voltage and A1g Peak Width \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that higher voltages lead to enhanced graphitic ordering. If the carbon structure becomes more ordered at higher voltages, we might expect the A1g peak to become narrower, indicating a more uniform carbon environment. We can test this by examining the correlation between the voltage and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the A1g peak. A negative correlation would support the hypothesis, suggesting that as voltage increases, the A1g peak becomes narrower, indicating improved graphitic ordering. Since FWHM is not directly available, we can approximate it by looking at the absolute deviation of A1g_Center from its mean value at each voltage. The lower this deviation, the sharper the peak. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between voltage and the absolute deviation of the A1g peak position from its mean. Specifically, the Pearson correlation coefficient between Voltage and the absolute deviation of A1g_Center from its mean is not significantly different from zero. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a significant negative correlation between voltage and the absolute deviation of A1g peak position from its mean. Specifically, the Pearson correlation coefficient between Voltage and the absolute deviation of A1g_Center from its mean is significantly less than zero. \n test statistics: 1.0\n------- Round 4 ------- \n Falsification Test: Main hypothesis: \nThe ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,\nindicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical\nactivation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.\n\nExpected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation\n(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.\n \n Falsification Test name: Temporal Correlation of ID/IG Ratio at High Voltage (T-test) \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis suggests that the ID/IG ratio decreases significantly above 4.3V due to electrochemical activation. If this is true, we should observe a consistent *temporal* trend of decreasing ID/IG at each spatial pixel *after* the voltage exceeds 4.3V. This means that the ID/IG ratio at a given pixel should be negatively correlated with time *after* the voltage threshold is reached. We can test this by calculating the temporal correlation (e.g., Pearson's r) between ID/IG and Time_Min for each pixel, but only considering the data points where Voltage > 4.3V. We then perform a one-sample t-test on the distribution of correlation coefficients across all pixels to see if the mean correlation is significantly negative. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant negative temporal correlation between ID/IG ratio and Time_Min at voltages above 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the Pearson correlation coefficients between ID/IG and Time_Min for all pixels with V > 4.3V is greater than or equal to zero. \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is a significant negative temporal correlation between ID/IG ratio and Time_Min at voltages above 4.3V. Specifically, the mean of the Pearson correlation coefficients between ID/IG and Time_Min for all pixels with V > 4.3V is less than zero. We can perform a one-sample t-test to test if the mean correlation is significantly less than zero. \n test statistics: 1.0\n------- Round 5 ------- \n Falsification Test: Main hypothesis: \nThe ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,\nindicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical\nactivation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.\n\nExpected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation\n(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.\n \n Falsification Test name: Voltage Threshold for Significant ID/IG Decrease \n Falsification Test description: The main hypothesis states that the ID/IG ratio significantly decreases when the voltage exceeds 4.3V. This implies that 4.3V is a meaningful threshold. A falsification test would be to check if there's anything special about the ID/IG behavior specifically at 4.3V, compared to other voltage thresholds. If the decrease in ID/IG is simply a continuous function of voltage, rather than a threshold effect, then using 4.3V as a strict cutoff is not justified. We can test this by comparing the rate of change of ID/IG with respect to voltage around 4.3V to the rate of change at other voltage points. If 4.3V is a true threshold, the rate of change of ID/IG should be significantly steeper at 4.3V than at other voltages. We can calculate the derivative (or a discrete approximation of it) of ID/IG with respect to voltage for each pixel. Then, we can compare the distribution of these derivatives at voltages close to 4.3V (e.g., 4.2V-4.4V) to the distribution of derivatives at other voltage ranges (e.g., 3.5V-3.7V, 4.5V-4.7V). A significantly more negative distribution of derivatives around 4.3V would support the threshold hypothesis. \n Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges. Specifically, the distribution of the derivatives of ID/IG with respect to voltage in the range [4.2V, 4.4V] is not significantly different from the distribution of derivatives in other voltage ranges (e.g., [3.5V, 3.7V] and [4.5V, 4.7V]). \n Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: The rate of change of the ID/IG ratio with respect to voltage is significantly more negative around 4.3V compared to other voltage ranges.
