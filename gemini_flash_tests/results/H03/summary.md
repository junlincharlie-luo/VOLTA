# H03: ID_IG_Decreases_High_Voltage

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

The ID/IG ratio (carbon disorder indicator) decreases significantly when voltage exceeds 4.3V,
indicating enhanced graphitic ordering or preferential G-band enhancement due to electrochemical
activation of the carbon conductive network at high potentials.

Expected Result: Significant decrease (~10%) in ID/IG at V > 4.3V, with negative correlation
(r ~ -0.21) between ID/IG and voltage.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 152.7 seconds

## Rationale
The sequential testing procedure resulted in a "PASS" which means there is sufficient evidence to NOT reject the null hypothesis, thus the main hypothesis is assessed as False.
