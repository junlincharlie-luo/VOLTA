# H13: Oxygen_Release_Above_4p5V

**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Hypothesis

Irreversible oxygen evolution from the lattice occurs when voltage exceeds 4.5V during the first
charge activation cycle in Li-rich layered oxides.

Note: This hypothesis may NOT be verifiable with the current dataset. No oxygen-related
spectroscopic signatures (e.g., O2 Raman modes, mass spectrometry data) are provided. Raman
peaks tracked are M-O vibrations and carbon bands only.


## Result
- **Conclusion**: False
- **Elapsed Time**: 161.6 seconds

## Rationale
Both falsification tests failed to find evidence supporting the hypothesis that irreversible oxygen evolution causes significant changes in M-O vibrations after exceeding 4.5V. The spatial correlation of M-O vibrations did not decrease significantly, and the spatial heterogeneity of M-O vibration intensity changes was not significantly higher after the voltage threshold. The combined result of these tests provides sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis.
